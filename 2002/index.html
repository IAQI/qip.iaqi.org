<h1>
QIP 2002&nbsp; -- The Fifth Workshop on Quantum Information Processing</h1>

<h2>

IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, New York</h2>

<h2>
January 14-17, 2002</h2>
Quantum information processing is the intersection of quantum mechanics
and computer science. It tries to improve on classical computers and classical
complexity bounds by making use of quantum mechanical phenomena. After
Peter Shor's 1994 discovery of efficient quantum algorithms for factoring
and the discrete log (threatening current "classical" cryptography), the
field has grown explosively and is now one of the hottest subfields of
both computer science and physics.
<p>QIP 2002&nbsp; is the fifth workshop on quantum computing, quantum cryptography,
and quantum information theory in the tradition of <a href="http://www.brics.dk/Activities/98/aqip/">AQIP
98</a> in Aarhus, <a href="http://aqip.cs.depaul.edu/aqip/">AQIP 99</a>
in Chicago,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/act/theme/1999/at_1999_12_05_an.html">QIP
2000</a> in Montr√©al, and <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/~qip/">QIP
2001 </a>at the CWI in Amsterdam.&nbsp;&nbsp; The conference will start
on the morning of Monday&nbsp; the 14th and will end sometime during the
afternoon of Thursday the 17th. It will consist of various invited talks
of 45 minutes each, a display of posters, and an open session. The slots
of the open session will be distributed during the conference itself. There
will not be published proceedings.
