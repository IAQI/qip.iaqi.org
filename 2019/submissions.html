<h2>Call for submissions</h2>
<p>
The Conference on Quantum Information Processing (QIP) series is the premier annual meeting for theoretical quantum information research. Since 1998, the conference has featured breakthroughs by the leaders in the disciplines of computing, cryptography, information theory, mathematics and physics. The scientific objective of the series is to gather the theoretical quantum information community to present and discuss the latest groundbreaking work in the field. In 2018, QIP was held in Delft.
</p>
<p>
QIP 2019 is the 22nd Annual Conference on Quantum Information Processing and will be hosted by JILA and the University of Colorado at Boulder. QIP 2019 will feature a tutorial program, plenary talks, contributed talks, and a poster session.
</p>
<p>
We invite contributions, both for talks and posters, on outstanding recent research in the area of the theory of quantum information and computation.  There will be a QIP Best Student Paper prize awarded. QIP will feature parallel tracks on each day of the conference. 
</p>

<h3>Important dates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Submission of talks deadline: Monday, 1 October 2018 at 23:59 Anywhere-on-Earth (AoE)</li>
<li>Poster-only submission deadline: Thursday, 25 October 2018 at 23:59 Anywhere-on-Earth (AoE)</li>
<li>Notification (for both talks and posters): Thursday, 8 November 2018</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission instructions</h3>
<p>
All submissions for talks or posters must be made electronically through the online submission system <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qip2019">EasyChair: QIP2019</a>.
</p>
<p>
Contributed talks at QIP are intended to be representative of outstanding recent research contributions to the theory of quantum information and computation. In addition to a title and a short abstract (for the conference webpage in case of acceptance) each submission to QIP for a talk should consist of two components:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Extended Abstract:</span> This should be 1 to 3 pages in length and contain a nontechnical, clear, and insightful description of the results and main ideas, their potential impact, and their importance to quantum information and computation. Extended abstracts should not consist of a compressed version of a full paper, but instead should facilitate an intuitive understanding of the research results that they represent and help the program committee in assessing their importance. Extended abstracts should be in PDF format, and typeset in single-column form with reasonable margins and font size at least 11 points. The 3 page maximum does not include references.
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Technical Manuscript:</span> This is a full paper of the work, including technical details. This manuscript may be from an on-line repository, such as arXiv; however a PDF copy of it must be uploaded. If your submission consists of multiple technical papers they should be merged into a single file. The Program Committee reserves the right to decide how to treat submissions that deviate from the above format (and reserves the right to reject such submissions solely on the basis of their format).
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best student paper prize</h3>

<p>
A submission is eligible for the student prize if and only if the main author(s) is/are a student(s) at the time of the submission and will present the work at QIP, and further a significant portion of the work (at least 60%) must have been done by said student(s), including the majority of the key ideas. Eligibility can only be indicated at the time of submission. All authors are notified if their paper has been labelled as eligible for the student prize, and have 14 days following submission to voice any disagreements about the paper's nomination to the PC chair. The PC chair is free to ask for any clarifications regarding the students' contributions at any time.
</p>

<h3>Instructions for poster-only submissions</h3>

<p>
Poster submissions use the same link as talk submissions. For poster-only submissions, only title and abstract are required (i.e., an extended abstract is not needed). A technical manuscript can be attached. Please indicate in the required field "speaker" the person that will present the poster at the conference.
</p>

<h3>Easychair instructions</h3>

<p>
Go to <a href="https://easychair.org/">easychair.org</a> and in the upper-right corner, click on "signup" (if you have not used easychair before) or "login" (if you have). Click on "New Submission" and follow the instructions. Please check the group box for Best Student Paper Prize only if all co-authors of this submission are aware of the eligibility criteria of the prize and actually support the choice. You may update or withdraw submissions up until the deadline, and only the latest version will be reviewed.
</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>
Please direct any questions or comments to the PC chair at <a href="mailto:qip2019@easychair.org">qip2019@easychair.org</a>.
