<em>
An improved area law for 1D frustration-free systems
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: We present a new proof for the 1D area law for frustration-free 
systems with a constant gap, which exponentially improves the entropy 
bound in Hastings' 1D proof. For particles of dimension d, a spectral 
gap \eps>0 and interaction strength of at most J, our entropy 
bound is S &lt= O(1)X^3 log^8 X where X=(J log d)/ \eps, 
versus the e^{O(X)} in Hastings' proof. Our proof is completely 
combinatorial. It follows the simple proof of the commuting case, 
combining the detectability lemma with basic tools from approximation 
theory. In higher dimensions, we manage to slightly improve the bound, 
showing that the entanglement entropy between a region L and its 
surrounding is bounded by S &lt;= O(1) |\partial L|^2 log^8|\partial 
L|, which in 2D is very close to the (trivial) volume-law.

<em>
Information Causality is a Special Point in the Dual of the Gray-Wyner Region
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: Information Causality puts restrictions on the amount of 
information learned by a party (Bob) in a one-way communication problem. 
Bob receives an index b, and after a one-way communication from the other 
party (Alice), tries to recover a part of Alice's input. Because of the 
possibility of cloning, this game in its completely classical form is 
equivalent to one in which there are several Bobs indexed by b, who are 
interested in recovering different parts of Alice's input string, after 
receiving a public message from her. Adding a private message from Alice 
to each Bob, and assuming that the game is played many times, we obtain 
the Gray-Wyner problem for which a complete characterization of the 
achievable region is known. In this paper, we first argue that in the 
classical case Information Causality is only a single point in the dual of 
the Gray-Wyner region. Next, we show that despite the fact that cloning is 
impossible in a general physical theory, the result from classical world 
carries over to any physical theory provided that it satisfies a new 
property. This new property of the physical theory is called the 
Accessibility of Mutual Information and holds in the quantum theory. It 
implies that the Gray-Wyner region completely characterizes all the 
inequalities corresponding to the game of Information Causality. In other 
words, we provide infinitely many inequalities that Information Causality 
is only one of them.
<br />
<br />

In the second part of the paper we prove that Information Causality leads 
to a non-trivial lower bound on the communication cost of simulating a 
given non-local box when the parties are allowed to share entanglement. We 
also consider the same problem when the parties are provided with 
preshared randomness. Our non-technical contribution is to comment that 
information theorists who have been interested in the area of control have 
independently studied the same problem in a different context from an 
information theoretic perspective, rather than a communication complexity 
one. Connecting these two lines of research, we report a formula that, 
rather surprisingly, gives an exact computable expression for the optimal 
amount of communication needed for sampling from a non-local distribution 
given infinite preshared randomness.

<em>
Simplified instantaneous non-local quantum 
computation with applications to position-based cryptography
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: Motivated by concerns that non-local measurements may violate 
causality, Vaidman has shown that any non-local operation can be 
implemented using local operations and a single round of simultaneously 
passed classical communication only. His protocols are based on a highly 
non-trivial recursive use of teleportation. Here we give a simple proof of 
this fact, reducing the amount of entanglement required from a doubly 
exponential to an exponential amount. We also prove a linear lower bound 
on the amount of entanglement consumed for the implementation of a certain 
non-local measurement.
<br />
These results have implications for position-based cryptography: any 
scheme becomes insecure if the adversaries share an amount of entanglement 
scaling exponentially in the number of communicated qubits. Furthermore, 
certain schemes are secure under the assumption that the adversaries have 
at most a linear amount of entanglement and are required to communicate 
classically.

Span Programs for Functions with Constant-Sized 1-certificates
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: Besides the Hidden Subgroup Problem, the second large class of
quantum speed-ups is for functions with constant-sized 1-certificates.
This includes the OR function, solvable by the Grover algorithm,
the distinctness, the triangle and other problems. The usual way to solve 
them
is by quantum walk on the Johnson graph.
<br />
<br />

We propose a solution for the same problems using span programs. The
span program is a computational model equivalent to the quantum query
algorithm in its strength, and yet very different in its outfit.
<br />
<br />

We prove the power of our approach by designing a quantum algorithm for 
the
triangle problem with query complexity O(n^{35/27}) that is better than 
O(n^{13/10}) of the best previously known algorithm by Magniez et al.

<em>
Discrete simulations of 
continuous-time query algorithms  that are efficient with respect to 
queries, gates and space
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: We show that any continuous-time quantum query algorithm whose 
total query time is T and whose driving Hamiltonian is implementable with 
G gates can be simulated by a discrete-query quantum algorithm using the 
following resources:
* O(T log T / loglog T) queries
* O(T G polylog T) 1- and 2-qubit gates
* O(polylog T) qubits of space.
This extends previous results where the query cost is the same or better, 
but where the orders of the second and third resource costs are at least 
T^2 polylog T and T polylog T respectively. These new bounds are useful in 
circumstances where abstract black-box query algorithms are translated 
into concrete algorithms with subroutines substituted for the black-box 
queries. In these circumstances, what matters most is the total gate 
complexity, which can be large if the cost of the operations performed 
between the queries is large (even if the number of queries is small). Our 
bound implies that if the implementation cost of the driving Hamiltonian 
is small, the total gate complexity is not much more than the query 
complexity.

Paranoid tomography:  Confidence regions for quantum hardware
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: Many ``paranoid'' quantum information processing protocols, such 
as fault tolerance and cryptography, require rigorously validated quantum 
hardware.  We use tomography to characterize and calibrate such devices.  
But point estimates of the state or gate implemented by a device -- which 
are the end result of all current tomographic protocols -- can never 
provide the rigorously reliable validation required for fault tolerance or 
QKD.  We need region estimators.  Here, I introduce likelihood-ratio 
confidence region estimators, and show that (unlike ad hoc techniques such 
as the bootstrap) they are absolutely reliable and near-optimally 
powerful, as well as convenient and simple to implement.

<em>
Local random quantum circuits are approximate polynomial-designs
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: We prove that local random quantum circuits acting on n qubits 
composed of polynomially many nearest neighbor two-qubit gates form an 
approximate unitary poly(n)-design. Previously it was unknown whether 
random quantum circuits were a t-design for any t > 3.
<br />
<br />

The proof is based on an interplay of techniques from quantum many-body 
theory, representation theory, and the theory of Markov chains. In 
particular we employ a result of Nachtergaele for lower bounding the 
spectral gap of frustration-free quantum local Hamiltonians; a 
quasi-orthogonality property of permutation matrices; and a result of 
Oliveira which extends to the unitary group the path-coupling method for 
bounding the mixing time of random walks.
<br />
<br />

We also consider pseudo-randomness properties of local random quantum 
circuits of small depth and prove they constitute a quantum poly(n)-copy 
tensor product expander. The proof also rests on techniques from quantum 
many-body theory, in particular on the detectability lemma of Aharonov, 
Arad, Landau, and Vazirani.
<br />
<br />

We give two applications of the results. Firstly we show the following 
pseudo- randomness property of efficiently generated quantum states: 
almost every state of n qubits generated by circuits of size n.k cannot be 
distinguished from the maximally mixed state by circuits of size 
n^((k+4)/6); this provides a data-hiding scheme against computationally 
bounded adversaries. Secondly, we reconsider a recent argument of Masanes, 
Roncaglia, and Acin concerning local equilibration of time-envolving 
quantum systems, and strengthen the connection between fast equilibration 
of small subsystems and the circuit complexity of the unitary which 
diagonalizes the Hamiltonian.

<em>
Merkle Puzzles in a Quantum World
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: In 1974, Ralph Merkle proposed the first unclassified scheme for secure communications over
insecure channels. When legitimate communicating parties are willing to spend an amount of
computational effort proportional to some parameter N, an eavesdropper cannot break into
their communication without spending a time proportional to N^2, which is quadratically more
than the legitimate effort. We showed in an earlier paper that Merkle's schemes are completely
insecure against a quantum adversary, but that their security can be partially restored if the
legitimate parties are also allowed to use quantum computation: the eavesdropper needed to
spend a time proportional to N^{3/2}
to break our earlier quantum scheme. Furthermore, all previous classical schemes could be broken completely by the onslaught of a quantum eavesdropper
and we conjectured that this is unavoidable.
We give two novel key establishment schemes in the spirit of Merkle's. The first one can
be broken by a quantum adversary that makes an effort proportional to N^{5/3}
to implement a
quantum random walk in a Johnson graph reminiscent of Andris Ambainis' quantum algorithm
for the element distinctness problem. This attack is optimal up to logarithmic factors. Our
second scheme is purely classical, yet it cannot be broken by a quantum eavesdropper who is
only willing to expend effort proportional to that of the legitimate parties.

<em>
Topological qubits: stability against thermal noise
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: A big open question in the quantum information theory concerns feasibility
of a self-correcting quantum memory. A user of such memory would need quantum computing 
capability only to write and read  information. The storage itself requires no action
from the user, as long as  the memory is put in contact with a cold enough 
thermal bath.
<br />
<br />

In this talk I will review toy models of a quantum memory based on stabilizer code
Hamiltonians with the topological order. These models describe quantum spin 
lattices with short-range interactions and a quantum code degenerate ground state.
I will show how to derive a lower bound on the memory time for stabilizer 
Hamiltonians that have no string-like logical operators, such as the recently
discovered 3D Cubic Code. This bound applies when the interaction between the spin 
lattice and the thermal bath can be described by a Markovian master equation.
Our results demonstrate that the 3D Cubic Code is a marginally self-correcting 
memory: for a fixed temperature T the maximum memory time that can be achieved
by increasing the lattice size grows exponentially with 1/T^2, whereas the optimal 
lattice size grows exponentially with 1/T.
<br />
<br />

We also compute the memory time of the 3D Cubic Code  numerically using a novel
error correction algorithm to simulate the readout step. The numerics suggests 
that our lower bound on the memory time is tight.
<br />
<br />

A unique feature of the studied stabilizer Hamiltonians responsible for the
self-correction is the energy landscape that penalizes any sequence of local errors 
resulting in a logical error. The energy barrier that must be overcome to implement
a bit-flip or phase-flip on the encoded qubit grows logarithmically with the 
lattice size. Such energy landscape also renders diffusion of topological
defects over large distances energetically unfavorable.

<em>
Disorder-assisted error correction in Majorana chains
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: It was recently realized that quenched disorder may enhance the 
reliability of topological qubits by reducing the mobility of anyons at 
zero temperature. Here we compute storage times with and without disorder 
for quantum chains with unpaired Majorana fermions - the simplest toy 
model of a quantum memory. Disorder takes the form of a random 
site-dependent chemical potential. The corresponding one-particle problem 
is a one-dimensional Anderson model with disorder in the hopping 
amplitudes. We focus on the zero-temperature storage of a qubit encoded in 
the ground state of the Majorana chain. Storage and retrieval are modeled 
by a unitary evolution under the memory Hamiltonian with an unknown weak 
perturbation followed by an error-correction step. Assuming dynamical 
localization of the one-particle problem, we show that the storage time 
grows exponentially with the system size. We give supporting evidence for 
the required localization property by estimating Lyapunov exponents of the 
one-particle eigenfunctions. We also simulate the storage process for 
chains with a few hundred sites. Our numerical results indicate that in 
the absence of disorder, the storage time grows only as a logarithm of the 
system size. We provide numerical evidence for the beneficial effect of 
disorder on storage times and show that suitably chosen pseudorandom 
potentials can outperform random ones.

<em>
Explicit lower and upper bounds on the entangled value of multiplayer XOR games
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: XOR games are the simplest model in which the nonlocal 
properties of entanglement manifest themselves. When there are two 
players, it is well known that the bias --- the maximum advantage over 
random play --- of entangled players is at most a constant times greater 
than that of classical players. Using tools from operator space theory, 
Perez-Garcia et al. [Comm. Math. Phys. 279 (2), 2008] showed that no such 
bound holds when there are three or more players: in that case the ratio 
of the entangled and classical biases can become unbounded and scale with 
the size of the game. 
<br />
<br />

We give a new, simple and explicit (though still probabilistic) 
construction of a family of three-player XOR games for which entangled 
players have a large advantage over classical players. Our game has N^2 
questions per player and entangled players have a factor of order sqrt(N) 
(up to log factors) advantage over classical players. Moreover, the 
entangled players only need to share a state of local dimension N and 
measure observables defined by tensor products of the Pauli matrices.
<br />
<br />

Additionally, we give the first upper bounds on the maximal violation in 
terms of the number of questions per player, showing that our construction 
is only quadratically off in that respect. Our results rely on 
probabilistic estimates on the norm of random matrices and higher-order 
tensors.

The Garden-Hose Game and Application to Position-Based Quantum Cryptography

<br />
Abstract: We study position-based cryptography in the quantum setting. We 
examine a class of protocols that only require the communication of a 
single qubit and 2n bits of classical information. To this end, we define 
a new model of communication complexity, the garden-hose model, which 
enables us to prove upper bounds on the number of EPR pairs needed to 
attack such schemes. This model furthermore opens up a way to link the 
security of quantum position-based cryptography to traditional complexity

Infinitely many constrained inequalities for the von Neumann entropy

Abstract: We exhibit infinitely many new, constrained inequalities for the 
von Neumann entropy,
and show that they are independent of each other and the known 
inequalities obeyed by the
von Neumann entropy (basically strong subadditivity). The new inequalities 
were proved
originally by Makarychev et al. [Commun. Inf. Syst., 2(2):147-166, 2002]

entropy, using properties of probability distributions. Our approach 
extends the proof of the

<em>
Optimal Bounds for Quantum Bit Commitment
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: 
Bit commitment is a fundamental cryptographic primitive with numerous 
applications. Quantum information allows for bit commitment schemes in the 
information theoretic setting where no dishonest party can perfectly 
cheat. The previously best-known quantum protocol by Ambainis achieved a 
cheating probability of at most 3/4[Amb01]. On the other hand, Kitaev 
showed that no quantum protocol can have cheating probability less than 
1/sqrt{2}[Kit03] (his lower bound on coin flipping can be easily extended 
to bit commitment). Closing this gap has since been an important and open 
question.
<br />
<br />

In this paper, we provide the optimal bound for quantum bit commitment. We 
first show a lower bound of approximately 0.739, improving Kitaev's lower 
bound. We then present an optimal quantum bit commitment protocol which 
has cheating probability arbitrarily close to 0.739. More precisely, we 
show how to use any weak coin flipping protocol with cheating probability 
1/2 + \eps in order to achieve a quantum bit commitment protocol with 
cheating probability 0.739 + O(\eps). We then use the optimal quantum weak 
coin flipping protocol described by Mochon[Moc07]. To stress the fact that 
our protocol uses quantum effects beyond the weak coin flip, we show that 
any classical bit commitment protocol with access to perfect weak (or 
strong) coin flipping has cheating probability at least 3/4.

The Complexity of the Separable Hamiltonian Problem
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: In this paper, we study variants of the canonical local 
hamiltonian problem where we have the additional promise that the witness 
is separable. We define two variants of the local problem. In the 
separable sparse hamiltonian problem, the hamiltonians are not necessarily 
local, but rather sparse. We show that this problem is QMA(2) complete. On 
the other hand, we consider another problem, the separable local 
hamiltonian problem and show that it is QMA complete. This should be 
compared to the local hamiltonian problem, and to the sparse hamiltonian 
problem which are both QMA complete. This is the first study of separable 
Hamiltonian problems which leads to new complete problems for both QMA and 
QMA(2) and might give some new ways of comparing these two classes.

Increasing Entanglement by 
Separable Operations and New Monotones for W-type Entanglement
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: In this talk, we seek to better understand the structure of 
local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and its relationship 
to separable operations (SEP).  To this end, we compare the abilities of 
LOCC and SEP for distilling EPR entanglement from one copy of an N-qubit 
W-class state (i.e. that of the form 
sqrt{x_0}|00...0&gt; + sqrt{x_1}|10...0&gt; +...+ sqrt{x_n}|00...1&gt;).  
In terms of transformation success probability, we are able to quantify a 
gap as large as 37% between the two classes.  Our work involves 
constructing new analytic entanglement monotones for W-class states which 
can increase on average by separable operations.  Additionally, we are 
able to show that the set of LOCC operations, considered as a subset of 
the most general quantum measurements, is not closed. Extended

<em>
Reliable Quantum State Tomography
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is the task of inferring the state of a 
quantum system by appropriate measurements.  Since the frequency 
distributions of the outcomes obtained from any finite number of 
measurements will generally deviate from their asymptotic limits, the 
estimation of the state can never be perfectly accurate, thus requiring 
the specification of error bounds. Furthermore, the individual 
reconstruction of matrix elements of the density operator representation 
of a state may lead to inconsistent results (e.g., operators with negative 
eigenvalues). Here we introduce a framework for quantum state tomography 
that enables the computation of accurate and consistent estimates and 
reliable error bars from a finite set of data and show that these have a 
well-defined and universal operational significance. The method does not 
require any prior assumptions about the distribution of the possible 
states or a specific parametrization of the state space.  The resulting 
error bars are tight, corresponding to the fundamental limits that quantum 
theory imposes on the precision of measurements. At the same time, the 
technique is practical and particularly well suited for tomography on 
systems consisting of a small number of qubits, which are currently in the 
focus of interest in experimental quantum information science.

<em>
Three Proofs of a Constructive Commuting Quantum Lovasz Local Lemma
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: The recently proven Quantum Lovasz Local Lemma generalises the 
well-known Lovasz Local Lemma. It states that, if a collection of subspace 
constraints are "weakly dependent", there necessarily exists a state 
satisfying all constraints. It implies e.g. that certain instances of the 
quantum kQSAT satisfiability problem are necessarily satisfiable, or that 
many-body systems with "not too many" interactions are never frustrated. 
However, the QLLL only asserts existence; it says nothing about how to 
find the state. Inspired by Moser's breakthrough classical results, we 
present a constructive version of the QLLL in the setting of commuting 
constraints, proving that a simple quantum algorithm converges efficiently 
to the required state. In fact, we provide three different proofs, all of 
which are independent of the original QLLL proof. So these results also 
provide independent, constructive proofs of the commuting QLLL itself, but 
strengthen it significantly by giving an efficient algorithm for finding 
the state whose existence is asserted by the QLLL.

Practical characterization of quantum devices without tomography
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: Quantum tomography is the main method used to assess the quality 
of quantum information processing devices, but its complexity presents a 
major obstacle for the characterization of even moderately large systems.  
However, tomography generates much more information than is often sought. 
Taking a more targeted approach, we develop schemes that enable (i) 
estimating the fidelity of an experiment to a theoretical ideal 
description, (ii) learning which description within a reduced subset best 
matches the experimental data. Both these approaches yield a significant 
reduction in resources compared to tomography. In particular, we show how 
to estimate the fidelity between a predicted pure state and an arbitrary 
experimental state using only a constant number of Pauli 
expectation values selected at random according to an importance-weighting 
rule. In addition, we propose methods for certifying quantum circuits and 
learning continuous-time quantum dynamics that are described by local 
Hamiltonians or Lindbladians. This extended abstract is a synthesis of 
arXiv:1104.3835 and arXiv:1104.4695, which the reader can consult for 
complete details on the results, methods and proofs.

Quantum rate distortion, 
reverse Shannon theorems, and source-channel separation
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: We derive quantum counterparts of two key theorems of classical 
information theory, namely, the rate distortion theorem and the 
source-channel separation theorem. The rate-distortion theorem gives the 
ultimate limits on lossy data compression, and the source-channel 
separation theorem implies that a two-stage protocol consisting of 
compression and channel coding is optimal for transmitting a memoryless 
source over a memoryless channel. In spite of their importance in the 
classical domain, there has been surprisingly little work in these areas 
for quantum information theory. In the present work, we prove that the 
quantum rate distortion function is given in terms of the regularized 
entanglement of purification. Although this formula is regularized, at the 
very least it demonstrates that Barnum's conjecture on the achievability 
of the coherent information for quantum rate distortion is generally 
false. We also determine single-letter expressions for 
entanglement-assisted quantum rate distortion. Moreover, we prove several 
quantum source channel separation theorems. The strongest of these are in 
the entanglement-assisted setting, in which we establish a necessary and 
sufficient condition for transmitting a memoryless source over a memoryless 
quantum channel up to a given distortion.

<em>
Hidden Symmetry Subgroup Problems
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: We advocate a new approach of addressing hidden structure 
problems and
finding efficient quantum algorithms. We introduce and investigate the
Hidden Symmetry Subgroup Problem (HSSP), which is a generalization of
the well-studied Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP). Given a group acting
on a set and an oracle whose level sets define a partition of the set,
the task is to recover the subgroup of symmetries of this partition
inside the group. The HSSP provides a unifying framework that, besides
the HSP, encompasses a wide range of algebraic oracle problems,
including quadratic hidden polynomial problems. While the HSSP can
have provably exponential quantum query complexity, we obtain
efficient quantum algorithms for various interesting cases. To achieve
this, we present a general method for reducing the HSSP to the HSP,
which works efficiently in several cases related to symmetries of
polynomials. The HSSP therefore connects in a rather surprising way
certain hidden polynomial problems with the HSP. Using this
connection, we obtain the first efficient quantum algorithm for the
hidden polynomial problem for multivariate quadratic polynomials over
fields of constant characteristic. We also apply the new methods to
polynomial function graph problems and present an efficient quantum
procedure for constant degree multivariate polynomials over any field.
This result improves in several ways the currently known algorithms.

Equivalence of Topological Codes and Fast Decoding Algorithms

Advances in classical communication for network quantum information theory
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: Our group has developed new techniques that have yielded 
significant advances in network quantum information theory. We have 
established the existence of a quantum simultaneous decoder for two-sender 
quantum multiple access channels by using novel methods to deal with the 
non-commutativity of the many operators involved, and we have also applied 
this result in various scenarios, included unassisted and assisted 
classical communication over quantum multiple access channels, quantum 
broadcast channels, and quantum interference channels. Prior researchers 
have already considered classical communication over quantum 
multiple-access and broadcast channels, but our work extends and in some 
cases improves upon this prior work. Also, we are the first to make 
progress on the capacity of the quantum interference channel, which is a 
channel with two senders and two receivers, where one sender is interested 
in communicating with one receiver and the other sender with the other 
receiver. The aim of the proposed talk at QIP 2012 is to summarize this 
recent work and its applications as well as to discuss new avenues for 
network quantum information theory that may make use of these results.

An operational framework for nonlocality
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: Since the advent of the first quantum information protocols,
entanglement was recognized as a key ingredient for quantum
information purposes, necessary for quantum
computation or cryptography. A framework was developed to characterize and 
quantify entanglement
as a resource based on the following operational principle:
entanglement among N parties cannot be created by local
operations and classical communication, even when N-1 parties
collaborate. More recently, nonlocality has been
identified as another resource, alternative to entanglement and
necessary for device-independent quantum information
protocols. We introduce a novel framework for
nonlocality based on a similar principle: nonlocality among N
parties cannot be created by local operations and shared
randomness even when N-1 parties collaborate. We then show that
the standard definition of multipartite nonlocality, due to
Svetlichny, is inconsistent with this
operational approach: according to it, genuine tripartite
nonlocality could be created by two collaborating parties. We then
discuss alternative definitions for which consistency is
recovered.

Quantum correlations require multipartite information principles
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: Identifying which correlations among distant observers are 
possible within our current description of Nature, based on quantum 
mechanics, is a fundamental problem in Physics. Recently, information 
concepts have been proposed as the key ingredient to characterize the set 
of quantum correlations. Novel information principles, such as, 
information causality or non-trivial communication complexity, have been 
introduced in this context and successfully applied to some concrete 
scenarios. We show in this work a fundamental limitation of this approach: 
no principle based on bipartite information concepts is able to single out 
the set of quantum correlations for an arbitrary number of parties. Our 
results reflect the intricate structure of quantum correlations and imply 
that new and intrinsically multipartite information concepts are needed 
for their full understanding.

Hardness of approximation for quantum problems
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: The polynomial hierarchy plays a central role in classical 
complexity theory. Here, we define a quantum generalization of the 
polynomial hierarchy, and initiate its study. We show that not only are 
there natural complete problems for the second level of this quantum 
hierarchy, but that these problems are in fact strongly hard to 
approximate. Our results thus yield the first known hardness of 
approximation results for a quantum complexity class. Our approach is 
based on the use of dispersers, and is inspired by the classical results 
of Umans regarding hardness of approximation for the second level of the 
classical polynomial hierarchy [Umans, FOCS 1999].

Parallel approximation of min-max problems with applications to classical and quantum zero-sum games
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient parallel algorithm for a new 
class of min-max problems based on the matrix multiplicative weight (MMW) 
update method. Our algorithm can be used to find near-optimal strategies 
for competitive two-player classical or quantum games in which a referee 
exchanges any number of messages with one player followed by any number of 
additional messages with the other. This algorithm considerably extends 
the class of games which admit parallel solutions and demonstrates for the 
first time the existence of a parallel algorithm for any game
(classical or quantum) in which one player reacts adaptively to the other.
<br />
<br />

As a direct consequence, we prove that several competing-provers 
complexity classes collapse to PSPACE such as QRG(2), SQG and two new 
classes called DIP and DQIP. A special case of our result is a parallel 
approximation scheme for a new class of semidefinite programs whose 
feasible region consists of n-tuples of semidefinite
matrices that satisfy a .transcript-like. consistency condition. Applied 
to this special case, our algorithm yields a direct polynomial-space 
simulation of multi-message quantum interactive proofs resulting in a 
first-principles proof
of QIP = PSPACE. It is noteworthy that our algorithm establishes a new 
way, called the min-max approach, to solve SDPs in contrast to the 
primal-dual approach to SDPs used in the original proof of QIP = PSPACE.

Local stabilizer codes in three dimensions without string logical operators

<br />
Abstract: We suggest concrete models for self-correcting quantum memory by 
reporting examples of local stabilizer codes in 3D that have no string 
logical operators. Previously known local stabilizer codes in 3D all have 
string-like logical operators, which make the codes non-self-correcting. 
We introduce a notion of "logical string segments" to avoid difficulties

every string-like logical operator of our code can be deformed to a 
disjoint union of short segments, and each segment is in the stabilizer

The Link between Uncertainty Relations and Non-Locality
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: Two of the most intriguing features of quantum physics are the 
uncertainty principle and the occurrence of non-local correlations. The 
uncertainty principle states that there exist pairs of non-compatible 
measurements on quantum systems such that their outcomes cannot be 
simultaneously predicted by any observer. Non-local correlations of 
measurement outcomes at different locations cannot be explained by 
classical physics, but appear in quantum mechanics in the presence of 
entanglement. Here, we show that these two essential properties of quantum 
mechanics are quantitatively related. Namely, we provide an entropic 
uncertainty relation that gives a lower bound on the uncertainty of the 
binary outcomes of two measurements in terms of the maximum 
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt value that can be achieved using the same 
measurements. We discuss an application of this uncertainty relation to 
certify a quantum source using untrusted devices.

A quantum information cost trade-off for the Augmented Index
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: In this work we establish a trade-off between the amount of 
(classical and) quantum information the two parties necessarily reveal 
about their inputs in the process of the computing Augmented Index, a 
natural variant of the Index function. A surprising feature of this 
trade-off is that it holds even under a distribution on inputs on which 
the function value is 'known in advance'. In fact, this is the price paid 
by any protocol that works correctly on a ``hard'' distribution. We show 
that quantum protocols that compute the Augmented Index function correctly 
with constant error on the uniform distribution, either Alice reveals 
Omega(n/t) information about her n-bit input, or Bob reveals Omega(1/t) 
information about his (log n)-bit input, where t is the number of messages 
in the protocol, even when the inputs are drawn from an ``easy'' 
distribution, the uniform distribution over inputs which evaluate to 0.
<br />
<br />

The classical version of this result has implications for the space 
required by streaming algorithms---algorithms that scan the input 
sequentially only a few times, while processing each input symbol quickly 
using a small amount of space. It implies that certain context free 
properties need space Omega(sqrt(n)/T) on inputs of length n, when allowed 
T unidirectional passes over the input. The quantum
version would have similar consequences, provided a certain information
inequality holds.

<em>
Fault-tolerant quantum computing with color codes
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: We present and analyze protocols for fault-tolerant quantum 
computing using
color codes.   To process these codes, no qubit movement is necessary;
nearest-neighbor gates in two spatial dimensions suffices.  Our focus is 
on
the color codes defined by the 4.8.8 semiregular lattice, as they provide
the best error protection per physical qubit among color codes.  We 
present
circuit-level schemes for extracting the error syndrome of these codes
fault-tolerantly.  We further present an integer-program-based decoding
algorithm for identifying the most likely error given the (possibly 
faulty)
syndrome.  We simulated our syndrome extraction and decoding algorithms
against three physically-motivated noise models using Monte Carlo methods,
and used the simulations to estimate the corresponding accuracy thresholds
for fault-tolerant quantum error correction.  We also used a self-avoiding
walk analysis to lower-bound the accuracy threshold for two of these noise
models.  We present two methods for fault-tolerantly computing with these
codes.  In the first, many of the operations are transversal and therefore
spatially local if two-dimensional arrays of qubits are stacked atop each
other.  In the second, code deformation techniques are used so that all
quantum processing is spatially local in just two dimensions.  In both
cases, the accuracy threshold for computation is comparable to that for
error correction.  Our analysis demonstrates that color codes perform
slightly better than Kitaev's surface codes when circuit details are
ignored.  When these details are considered, we estimate that color codes
achieve a threshold of 0.082(3)%, which is higher than the threshold of
1.3 times 10^{-5} achieved by concatenated coding schemes restricted to
nearest-neighbor gates in two dimensions [Spedalieri and Roychowdhury,
Quant. Inf. Comp. 9, 666 (2009)] but lower than the threshold
of 0.75% to 1.1% reported for the Kitaev codes subject to the same
restrictions [Raussendorf and Harrington, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98,
190504 (2007); Wang et al., Phys. Rev. A 83, 020302(R) (2011)].
Finally, because the behavior of our decoder's performance for two of the
noise models we consider maps onto an order-disorder phase transition in 
the
three-body random-bond Ising model in 2D and the corresponding
random-plaquette gauge model in 3D, our results also answer the Nishimori
conjecture for these models in the negative: the statistical-mechanical
classical spin systems associated to the 4.8.8 color codes are
counterintuitively more ordered at positive temperature than at zero
temperature.

Quantum query complexity for state conversion
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: State conversion generalizes query complexity to the problem of 
converting between two input-dependent quantum states by making queries to 
the input.  We characterize the complexity of this problem by introducing 
a natural information-theoretic norm that extends the Schur product 
operator norm.  The complexity of converting between two systems of states 
is given by the distance between them, as measured by this norm.  
<br />
<br />

In the special case of function evaluation, the norm is closely related to 
the general adversary bound, a semi-definite program that lower-bounds the 
number of input queries needed by a quantum algorithm to evaluate a 
function.  We thus obtain that the general adversary bound characterizes 
the quantum query complexity of any function whatsoever.  This generalizes 
and simplifies the proof of  the same result in the case of boolean input 
and output.  Also in the case of function evaluation, we show that our 
norm satisfies a remarkable composition property, implying that the 
quantum query complexity of the composition of two functions is at most 
the product of the query complexities of the functions, up to a constant.  
Finally, our result implies that discrete and continuous-time query models 
are equivalent in the bounded-error setting, even for the general 
state-conversion problem.

A strong direct product theorem for quantum query complexity
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: We show that quantum query complexity satisfies a strong direct 
product theorem.  This means that computing k copies of a function with 
less than k times the quantum queries needed to compute one copy of the 
function implies that the overall success probability will be 
exponentially small in k.  For a boolean function f we also show an 
XOR lemma---computing the parity of k copies of f with less than k 
times the queries needed for one copy implies that the advantage over 
random guessing will be exponentially small.  
<br />
<br />

We do this by showing that the multiplicative adversary method, which 
inherently satisfies a strong direct product theorem, is always at least 
as large as the additive adversary method, which is known to characterize 
quantum query complexity.

Improved Output-Sensitive Quantum Algorithms for Boolean

Abstract: We present new quantum algorithms for Boolean Matrix 
Multiplication in both the time complexity and the query complexity 
settings. As far as time complexity is concerned, our results show that 
the product of two n x n Boolean matrices can be computed on a quantum 
computer in time O(n^{3/2}+nk^{3/4}), where k is the number of non-zero 
entries in the product, improving over the output-sensitive quantum 
algorithm by Buhrman and Spalek (SODA'06) that runs in O(n^{3/2}k^{1/2}) 
time. This is done by constructing a quantum version of a recent classical 
algorithm by Lingas (ESA'09), using quantum techniques such as quantum 
counting to exploit the sparsity of the output matrix. As far as query 
complexity is concerned, our results improve over the quantum algorithm by 
Vassilevska Williams and Williams (FOCS'10) based on a reduction to the 
triangle finding problem. One of the main contributions leading to this 
improvement is the construction of a quantum algorithm for triangle 
finding tailored especially for the tripartite graphs appearing in the 
reduction.

Hedging bets with correlated quantum strategies

Abstract: This paper studies correlations among independently administered 
hypothetical tests of a simple interactive type, and demonstrates that 
correlations arising in quantum information theoretic variants of these 
tests can exhibit a striking non-classical behavior. When viewed in a 
game-theoretic setting, these correlations are suggestive of a perfect 
form of hedging, where the risk of a loss in one game of chance is 
perfectly offset by one's actions in a second game. This type of perfect 
hedging is quantum in nature, it is not possible in classical variants of

  the case of qubit channels we construct a coding scheme which, 
  using some pre-shared entanglement, asymptotically achieves a net

  for channels with sufficiently low noise level, no pre-shared
  entanglement is required.

Quantum rejection sampling
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: Rejection sampling is a well-known method to sample from a target distribution,
given the ability to sample from a given distribution. The method has been first 
formalized by von Neumann (1951) and has many applications in classical computing.
We define a quantum analogue of rejection sampling: given a black box producing 
a coherent superposition of (possibly unknown) quantum states with some amplitudes,
the problem is to prepare a coherent superposition of the same states, albeit 
with different target amplitudes. The main result of this paper is a tight characterization
of the query complexity of this quantum state generation problem. We 
exhibit an algorithm, which we call quantum rejection sampling,
and analyze its cost using semidefinite programming. Our proof of a matching lower bound is based 
on the automorphism principle which allows to
symmetrize any algorithm over the automorphism group of the problem.
<br />
<br />

Furthermore, we illustrate how quantum rejection sampling may be used as a primitive
in designing quantum algorithms, by providing three different applications. 
We first show that it was implicitly used in the quantum algorithm for linear systems
of equations by Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd. Secondly, we show that it can be 
used to speed up the main step in the quantum Metropolis sampling algorithm by Temme et al..
Finally, we derive a new quantum algorithm for the hidden shift 
problem of an arbitrary Boolean function.

Preparing projected entangled pair states on a quantum computer

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm to prepare injective PEPS on a 
quantum computer, a problem raised by Verstraete, Wolf, Perez-Garcia, and 
Cirac [PRL 96, 220601 (2006)]. To be efficient, our algorithm requires 
well-conditioned PEPS projectors and, essentially, an inverse-polynomial 
spectral gap of the PEPS' parent Hamiltonian. Injective PEPS are the 
unique groundstates of their parent Hamiltonians and capture groundstates 
of many physically relevant many-body Hamiltonians, such as e.g. the 2D 
AKLT state. Even more general is the class of G-injective PEPS which have 
parent Hamiltonians with a ground state space of degeneracy |G|, the order 
of the discrete symmetry group G. As our second result we show how to 
prepare G-injective PEPS under similar assumptions as well. The class of 
G-injective PEPS contains topologically ordered states, such as Kitaev's 
toric code which our algorithm is thus able to prepare.

Epsilon-net method for optimizations over separable states
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: In this paper we study the algorithms for the linear 
optimization
over separable quantum states, which is a NP-hard problem.
Precisely, the objective function is &lt;Q, \rho&gt; for some
hermitian Q where \rho is a separable quantum state. Our
strategy is to enumerate (via epsilon-nets) more cleverly with the
help of certain structure of some interesting Qs. As a result, we
obtain efficient algorithms either in time or space for the
following cases.
<br />
<br />

Firstly, we provide a polynomial time (or space) algorithm when Q
can be decomposed into
the form Q = sum_{i=1}^M Q^1_i tensor Q^2_i with small M. As a
direct consequence, we prove a variant of the complexity class
QMA(2) where the verifier performs only logarithm number of
unit gates acting on both proofs simultaneously is contained in
PSPACE. We also initiate the study of the natural extension
of the local Hamiltonian problem to the k-partite case. By the
same algorithm, we conclude those problems remain to be inside
PSPACE.
<br />
<br />

Secondly, for a positive semidefinite Q we obtain an algorithm with 
running
time exponential in the Frobenius norm of Q , which reproves one
of the main results of Brandao, Christandl and Yard [STOC
pp.343(2011)]. Note that this result was originally proved by making
use of many non-trivial results in quantum information, whereas our
algorithm only utilizes fundamental operations of matrices and the
Schmidt decomposition of bipartite pure states.

Spectral Gap Amplification

Abstract: Many problems in quantum information reduce to preparing a

quantum algorithms for these problems is determined by the 
inverse spectral gap of H for that eigenstate and the cost of 
evolving with H for some fixed time. The goal of spectral gap 
amplification is therefore to construct a Hamiltonian H' with the 
same eigenstate as that of H but a bigger spectral gap, requiring 
that constant-time evolutions with H' and H can be implemented 
with nearly the same cost.  We show that a quadratic spectral gap 
amplification is possible when H satisfies a frustration-free 
property and give H' for this case. This results in quantum speedups
for some adiabatic evolutions. Defining a suitable oracle model, we 
establish that the quadratic amplification is optimal for frustration-free 
Hamiltonians and that no spectral gap amplification is possible if the 
frustration-free property is removed. A corollary is that finding a 
similarity transformation between a stochastic Hamiltonian and the 
corresponding stochastic matrix is hard in the oracle model, setting 
strong limits in the power of some classical methods that simulate 
quantum adiabatic evolutions. Implications of spectral gap amplification 
for quantum speedups of optimization problems and the preparation of 
projected entangled pair states (PEPS) are discussed.

Bounds on the distance between a 
unital quantum channel and the convex hull of unitary channels, with 
applications to the asymptotic quantum Birkhoff conjecture
</em>
<br />
<br />
Abstract: Motivated by the recent resolution of Asymptotic Quantum 
Birkhoff Conjecture (AQBC), we attempt to estimate the distance between a 
given unital quantum channel and the convex hull of unitary channels. We 
provide two lower bounds on this distance by employing techniques from 
quantum information and operator algebra, respectively. We then show how 
to apply these results to construct some explicit counterexamples to AQBC.
