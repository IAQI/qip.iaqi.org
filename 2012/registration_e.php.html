<h3>NSF TRAVEL STUDENT AWARDS FOR QIP2012</h3>


<p align="justify">The National Science Foundation, which sponsors 
QIP2012, will have a total of $10,000 available to support travel for 
QIP2012.</p>

<p align="justify">The NSF travel awards are available to students and 
certain postdoctoral fellows studying in the US.  There will be up to 
$10,000 available in travel support (airfare and shared hotel 
accommodation) to fund at least 15 attendees with up to $675 each.  These 
awards are only available to those at US institutions.  Receipts will be 
required and reimbursement will be made after the conference.</p>

<p align="justify">Preference will be given to students who are QIP2012 
authors.  To apply, email the information listed below to 
<strong>qip-travel at cs dot washington dot edu</strong>, by 
<strong>November 1, 2011</strong>.  Please use the following subject 
line: "<strong>QIP2012 travel application</strong>".</p>

<p align="justify">The awards will be announced by November 8, 2011.  
Late applications will not be accepted.  You should receive an email 
acknowledging your application within three weekdays.  If not, please 
resubmit or contact the conference organizers by some other means.  For 
the application, please list the following:

<ol>
 <li>Title of paper or poster (if you are an author) and whether you will 
be presenting the paper or poster.</li>
 <li>Whether you are a student or a postdoctoral fellow.</li>
 <li>University name.</li>
 <li>Amount of other travel funds that are available to you.</li>

 <li><strong>(For non-authors)</strong>  A short statement describing 
your academic standing and interests, your expected graduation date and 
degree, advisor's name and, if available, a URL for a working webpage.  
Also indicate whether and when you have attended previous major similar 
conferences and whether or not you have received other travel awards to 
do so.</li>
 <li><strong>(For students)</strong>  A supporting statement from your 
advisor confirming your status, recommending your attendance, and 
describing the availability of travel funds.  This should be included in 
message with your name in the subject line which should be e-mailed to 
the <strong>qip-travel</strong> address above. (Note: vague statements 
such as "funds are tight" are not informative.)</li>
 <li>NSF encourages applications from members of under-represented groups 
for these awards. (<strong>Optional:</strong> please indicate if you are 
part of such a group or at an institution that is not typically 
represented at QIP.)</li>
 <li>Submit a US dollar estimate of the airfare/transportation cost to 
the conference and the number of nights you will be staying.  NSF 
requirements for travel grants stipulate that flights 
*<strong>must</strong>* be on U.S.-based airlines (i.e., you 
<u>cannot</u> be reimbursed for flights on Air Canada, KLM, British 
Airways, etc.). </li>
</ol>
<hr />
</p>

<p align="justify">Priority for Travel Awards will be based on the following:
<ul>
<li>Student authors and co-authors of accepted papers who do not have 
other support.</li>
<li>Members of under-represented groups or from institutions not 
traditionally represented at the conference with research interests in 
areas covered by QIP and whose attendance would broaden participation at 
the conference.</li>
<li>Student applicants whose statements and supporting information make 
particularly cogent justification for the benefit they will receive from 
attending the conference.</li>
<li>Postdoctoral authors of accepted papers who do not have other travel 
support.</li>
<li>First-time applicants and students who have not received travel 
stipends to QIP in the recent past.</li>
</ul>
