    The quantum correlations between spatially separated systems that were formerly in close
    contact but no longer interact, can have a mysterious quality, captured by the phrase
    &quot;quantum nonlocality&quot;.&nbsp; Attitudes toward this &quot;nonlocality&quot; vary
    from the view that nothing is nonlocal except the misguided attempt to explain the
    correlations in terms of nonexistent &quot;hidden variables&quot;, to the view that
    quantum mechanics has proved that what you decide to do over here can instantaneously
    alter the physical character of something over there. &nbsp; Such conceptually mysterious
    correlations have assumed a central role in quantum information theory. While the
    philosophical puzzles do not hinder the gedanken-practical application of the
    correlations, quantum information scientists might bear the puzzles in mind, on the chance
    that some of the exquisitely clever things they manage to do with entangled states might
    illuminate them.</td>

    Bell inequalities are upper bounds on the correlations of distant events. They involve
    only classical (Boolean) logic and the principle of local causes, namely: events that
    occur in a given spacetime region are independent of external parameters that may be
    controlled, at the same moment, by agents located in distant spacetime regions. Bell's
    momentous discovery was that these bounds might be exceeded by the correlations predicted
    by quantum mechanics. This review will include the following topics: <ol>
      <li>Derivation of generalized inequalities from Farkas's Lemma in convex analysis.</li>
      <li>Sequential tests with adaptive strategies.</li>

    We have discovered various ensembles of orthogonal bipartite (and multipartite) quantum
    states which show a variety of manifestations of quantum nonlocality. When their parts are
    shared between several parties, the identity of these states cannot be determined
    reliably, even if these parties are allowed any local quantum operations and any amount of
    classical communication. We discuss the mutual information attainable in these
    measurements as well as other measures of this nonlocality, such as the entropy produced
    when the parties are instructed to prepare one of the ensemble of states locally, and the
    amount of &quot;advice&quot; (classical data or quantum entanglement) needed to make the
    measurements doable. The difference between remote dephasing of states and remote
    measurement is clarified. </td>

    It is by now widely accepted that decoherence can single out a preferred pointer basis
    through the process known as environment-induced superselection (or einselection), and
    that its undoing is difficult as the monitoring by the environment is (effectively, if not
    in principle) irreversible. I shall analyse the nature of decoherence -- in particular,
    the reasons for why is it so difficult to undo -- from an algorithmic point of view. The
    consequences of decoherence shall be investigated from the same vantage point, which will
    lead in particular to an operational definition of probabilities. </p>

    A mixed state is called entangled (non-separable) if it is not a mixture of product
    states. It called <i>bound entangled</i> if it is entangled, but cannot be distilled i.e.
    brought to the maximally entangled form by means of local quantum operations and classical
    communication. A characterization of bound entangled states is given. It is proved that
    bound entangled states do not allow better than classical fidelity of teleportation. It is
    also shown that the set of all nondistillable states is compact. Two methods of seeking of
    bound entangled states are presented: (i) the one involving theory of positive maps, (ii)
    the one based on investigation of the range of the density matrix. New bound entangled
    states obtained within the first method are presented. It is also shown that the bound
    entanglement can be useful for quantum communication within a process analogous to the
    phenomenon of chemical activation. This supports the idea of entanglement-energy analogy.</td>

    We obtain easy examples of &quot;bound&quot; entanglement--entangled mixed states from
    which no pure entanglement is distillable--using the notion of an unextendible product
    basis, of which we give examples. We exhibit a bound-entangled state of a tripartite 2x2x2
    system that has no bipartite entanglement, in the sense that all three corresponding 2x4
    bipartite states are unentangled. We show that if a set of orthogonal product states is
    distinguishable by local von Neumann measurements and classical communication, then this
    set can be completed to a full basis. We give a set of states on 3x4 that is
    distinguishable by generalized measurements and can be completed in an extended Hilbert

    I will describe a classical randomized simulation of noisy quantum Turing machines and
    noisy quantum circuits. It is shown that for quantum Turing machine with any non-zero
    amount of noise , the simulation is efficient. Hence noisy quantum Turing machines have no
    computational advantage over classical computers. <br>
    The case of quantum circuits is qualitatively different. I will show that the classical
    simulation is efficient given that the noise is larger than a certain threshold.
    Interestingly, the cost of the simulation exhibits an abrupt transition from exponential
    to polynomial at a critical amount of noise. I will discuss some physical and
    computational implications of this abrupt transition. <br>
    The proofs involve percolation and branching processes techniques, and are presented in

    I will present some of the general theory of quantum error correction, while discussing
    recent work in the area of fault tolerant computing. There is a fundamental discrepancy
    between the conditions for efficient memory storage and those for simple operations to
    evolve a quantum computation. This causes a trade-off between the required scale-up in
    computer size and the achieved noise tolerance. This trade-off will be shown to be largely
    avoidable, by adapting the recovery operation so that it simultaneously corrects errors
    and evolves the computation by performing a useful measurement. Combining this with recent
    work on finding good quantum error correcting codes, and some improvements in the way
    error information is extracted, it is found that, under the standard model of ubiquitous
    stochastic, uncorrelated noise, a quantum computer need be only an order of magnitude
    larger than the logical machine contained within it in order to be reliable.</td>

    In this talk, we will present a set of recent results on universal gates and
    fault-tolerant (FT) quantum computing. Several sets of gates have been proved to be
    universal for quantum computing; however, sets of gates that are universal for
    fault-tolerant quantum computing have received only limited attention. The only proposed
    scheme for FT computation is based on the fault-tolerant realization of the following set
    of gates: the 3-qubit Toffoli gate, and the 1-qubit Hadamard and \sigma_z^{1/2} gates. A
    proof of universality of this set of gates, however, is not available in the literature.
    We present a new set (comprising of the 2-qubit Control-Not gate, and the 1-qubit Hadamard
    and \sigma_z^{1/4} gates) and prove it to be universal for FT computation. This is the
    first known FT universal set. Furthermore, it involves at most 2-qubit operations and can
    potentially enable FT computation in recently proposed schemes for realizing quantum
    computers that rely only on near-neighbor interactions. We shall also outline our recent
    results on the issue of whether measurements can be delayed in FT quantum computers. All
    the existing schemes use measurement during the process of fault tolerant computation, and
    methods for delaying the measurements have been ignored. However, the bulk computation
    model, which currently provides the best implementation for quantum algorithm, cannot
    operate unless measurements are delayed until the end. We present the first-known scheme
    for delaying measurements in a fault-tolerant manner. This is joint work with P. Oscar
    Boykin, Tal Mor, Matthew Pulver, and Farrokh Vatan.</td>

    Recent advances in communication complexity in a setting where quantum information is
    available are reviewed. Holevo's Theorem implies that <em>n</em> qubits cannot convey more
    classical information than <em>n</em> bits. Nevertheless, there are information processing
    tasks that require communication and for which using qubits instead of bits results in
    substantial savings. For example, a certain two-party scheduling problem can be solved
    with significantly less qubit communication than bit communication (this is joint work
    with Harry Buhrman and Avi Wigderson). We also investigate the communication complexity
    implicit in entangled quantum states, where a bipartite measurement is given from a set of
    possibilities. Bell's Theorem and its variants essentially imply that the correlations
    that arise between the two components cannot be simulated by using only classical
    correlations (a.k.a. &quot;local hidden variables&quot;) in place of true entanglement.
    This is under the assumption that no communication can occur between the components. If
    sufficient communication is permitted then the correlations can be simulated by classical
    means. We quantify the amount of communication necessary and sufficient for this
    simulation (this is joint work with Gilles Brassard and Alain Tapp).</td>

    Although Communication Complexity is not a recent topic in computer science, its relations
    to quantum information theory is much more recent. Following the result of R. Cleve and H.
    Buhrman, we now know that entanglement can significantly reduce the communication required
    for a set of players to compute some specific function of their private inputs. The most
    striking result is certainly the one of H. Buhrman, R. Cleve and A. Wigderson, which
    showed that the amount of reduction in communication can be exponential. In this talk I
    will show a specific problem involving two players that can be solved with NO
    communication if the players shared <em>n</em> EPR pairs, but would require
    2^{\Omega(n)}bits of classical communication without it. This form of
    &quot;Pseudo-Telepathy&quot; can also be used to obtain a lower bound on the amount of
    communication required to simulate <em>n</em> EPR pairs: how much communication need we
    allow a local model of the world to perfectly simulate entanglement? This work has been
    done in collaboration with G. Brassard and R. Cleve. Clearly, the fact that entanglement
    can be substituted for communication is intriguing, especially since it is known that,
    strictly speaking, entanglement cannot be used to send messages or even to compress them.
    Why does it reduce communication complexity? In fact entanglement is not always useful to
    solve communication problems. I will also show that for the specific two-player problem of
    computing the inner product of their privates inputs, entanglement is of no help. This
    work has been done in collaboration with R. Cleve, W. van Dam and M. Nielsen.</td>

    A computational problem is said to be in BQNP if it can be defined in terms of a quantum
    witness verifiable on a quantum computer in polynomial time. (The abbreviation stands for
    &quot;bounded error probability, quantum nondeterministic polinomial&quot;). The following
    problem is shown to be BQNP complete: decide whether a &quot;local Hamiltonian&quot; (a
    sum of several Hermitian operators, each involving a constant number of qubits) has an
    eigenvalue smaller then <em>a</em>, or all the eigenvalues are larger than<em> b</em>,
    where 1/(<em>b</em>-<em>a</em>) is polynomial.</td>

    One can view the class BQP of problems efficiently computable on quantum computers in one
    of two ways:</p>
    <p>A class of problems captured by a new paradigm of computation built on deep principles
    of quantum mechanics. <ul>
      <li>A class of problems captured by a new paradigm of computation built on deep principles
        of quantum mechanics.</li>
      <li>Yet another complexity class.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a complexity theorist I wish to explore the latter view. BQP is usually describe in
    a mysterious way using messy definitions with awful notation. In actuality, BQP makes for
    a rather nice complexity class: <ul>
      <li>BQP is robust--small changes to the definition do not affect the set of languages in the
        class.</li>
      <li>BQP contains interesting problems, such as factoring, not known to be contained in
        smaller classes.</li>
      <li>BQP does have rather simple characterizations that are understandable to computer
        scientists with no knowledge of the underlying physics.</li>
      <li>BQP has interesting relationships with other well-studied complexity classes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will discuss these issues and talk about why understanding them leads to a much
    clearer picture of the power of quantum computation. We will discuss other quantum related
    classes and mention several interesting open questions. </td>

    The success probability of a classical randomized algorithm can be boosted by repetition:
    If the algorithm succeeds with probability<em> a</em>, then by repeating the algorithm <em>k</em>
    times, we can increase the probability of success to roughly <em>ka</em>, assuming <em>ka</em>
    \ll 1. Intuitively, we can think of this basic strategy as each additional run of the
    given algorithm boosting the probability of success by an additive amount of roughly <em>a</em>.
    On a quantum computer, we can of course also apply this classical method to boosting the
    probability of success. In each of the<em> k</em> runs, we apply the algorithm on the
    given classical input to create a superposition which we then measure. Our probability of
    measuring the correct answer is <em>a</em>. In other words, the amplitude by which we
    measure the correct answer is of norm \sqrt a. Now, suppose that we in each additional run
    of the given algorithm could add the amplitudes, so that after just \sqrt a repetitions,
    our amplitude of success is \sqrt{ka}. Then our probability of success would still be <em>ka</em>
    as on the classical computer, but our total work much less. Unfortunately, such an
    improved method cannot exist because of the unitary restriction, but fortunately, a
    slightly modified version of it does. I call this amplitude amplification. In this talk, I
    will describe the concept of amplitude amplification, when it applies, and when it does
    not. I will give several examples, many of which goes beyond boosting success
    probabilities, and many of which have no classical analogues.</td>

    Most algorithms in Quantum Computation are developed in the black box setting. This is the
    setting where we are interested in determining the property of some function<em> f</em> :
    {0,1}^<em>n</em> \mapsto {0,1}. The algorithms are geared to determine this property with
    as few applications---black-box calls---of&nbsp; <em>f</em> as possible. For example
    Grovers algorithm determines the property whether there exists a <em>x </em>\in {0,1}^<em>n</em>
    such that <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 1 using only \sqrt{2^n} calls of <em>f</em>. We will
    discuss the limitations of this black-box approach. As a tool we will show how to
    translate any quantum algorithm into a multivariate polynomial. It now follows that a
    lower bound on the degree of the polynomial that corresponds to the property of <em>f </em>is
    a lower on the number of applications of <em>f</em> that any quantum algorithm needs to
    make to determine this property. We will review some of the recent results obtained using
    this method. In particular we will show that for any property the advantage that a quantum
    algorithm can have over a classical deterministic algorithm is at most a polynomial.</td>

    Besides their use for efficient computation, quantum computers are a base for studying
    quantum systems that create valid physical theories using mathematics and physics. An
    essential part of the validation process for quantum mechanics is the development of a
    coherent theory of mathematics and quantum mechanics together. Such a theory should
    combine mathematical logical concepts with quantum mechanics. That this might be possible
    is shown here by defining truth, validity, consistency, and completeness for a quantum
    mechanical version of a simple classical expression enumeration machine described by
    Smullyan. It is seen that for an interpretation based on a Feynman path sum over
    expression path states, truth, consistency, and completeness have different properties
    than for the classical system. For instance the truth of a sentence S is defined only on
    the paths containing S. It is undefined elsewhere. Also S and its negation can both be
    true provided they appear on separate paths. This satisfies the definition of consistency.
    It is seen that validity and completeness connect the system dynamics to the truth of the
    sentences. It is proved that validity implies consistency. The requirements of validity
    and maximal completeness strongly restrict the possible dynamics of the system. Aspects of
    the existence of a valid, maximally complete dynamics are discussed. It is shown that
    there exists a dynamics describing the evolution of a quantum computer that is also valid
    and complete for the set of sentences considered here.</td>

    An important problem in classical cryptography consists in finding the weakest assumption
    for the implementation of some fundamental primitives. One such a primtive is called<em>
    Zero-Knowledge Arguments</em> which allows a polynomial-time prover to convince a
    polynomial-time verifier of the validity of some statement without revealing any
    additional information. Naor, Ostrovski, Venkatesan and Young have shown that
    Zero-Knowledge Arguments for NP can be based upon any one-way permutation. The result
    follows from the construction of an unconditionally concealing bit commitment from any
    one-way permutation. The bit commitment scheme is interactive (requires <em>n</em>-1
    rounds where <em>n</em> is a security parameter) and works only if the one-way function is
    <em>almost</em> <em>k</em>-regular. In addition, if an advarsary succeeds in opening the
    bit of his choice with probability <em>S</em>(<em>n</em>) then the adversary can invert
    the function with success probability <em>I</em>(<em>n</em>) in O(<em>S</em>(<em>n</em>)/<em>n</em>^8).
    This kind of reduction is called polynomial preserving. It is unknown if a similar
    construction exists requiring less interaction or a weaker assumption on the structure of
    the one-way function. It is also not known how to diminish the gap between <em>S</em>(<em>n</em>)
    and <em>I</em>(<em>n</em>). In this talk, we look at what happens if one-way functions are
    replaced by quantum one-way functions and communication between the players can take place
    over a quantum channel. As shown by Mayers and independantly by Lo and Chau,
    unconditionally concealing quantum bit commitment scheme is impossible. Any such quantum
    bit commitment can be cheated by a sender applying an unitary transform defined from the
    protocol specifications. We show that there exists a scheme that can be cheated by the
    sender only if he can invert a quantum one-way permutation. The protocol is
    non-interactive meaning that is requires only one message during both the committing and
    the revealing phases. The reduction of the quantum algorithm for inverting the one-way
    permutation to an adversary of the bit commitment scheme is linear preserving whereas it
    is polynomial preserving in the classical case. We also argue that a similar construction
    can tolerate one-way functions that are not known to provide bit commitment using the
    interactive hashing technique. Our results suggest that perhaps even in a computational
    setting, quantum communication allows to base cryptography on weaker assumptions.</td>

    Can quantum mechanics be harnessed to provide unconditionally secure bit commitment
    schemes and other cryptographic primitives beyond key distribution? This was believed
    possible for several years until Mayers came along with his proof that the
    &quot;provably'' secure BCJL bit commitment scheme was fatally flawed. (This attack was
    found independently by Lo and Chau.) This discovery prompted several attempts at fixing
    the protocol, but every time <em>ad hoc</em> successful attacks soon followed. This
    cat-and-mouse game went on until Mayers proved that all these attempts had been in vain:
    unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment schemes are impossible. Despite all odds,
    various kinds of ideas continued to be proposed by some of us as well as others in the
    hope they would not fall prey to Mayers' result. Perhaps the most interesting approach
    consisted in using various types of short-lived<em> classical</em> bit commitment schemes
    to force the cheater to perform measurements at specified points in the execution of the
    protocol, which indeed would fix the problem. Alas, this strategy was doomed as
    measurements can always be postponed until cheating becomes possible.&nbsp; Despite their
    failure, these attempts contributed to enhance our understanding of what is going on with
    quantum bit commitment schemes and other quantum cryptographic protocols. The purpose of
    this talk is to review Mayers' result, describe some of the most promising suggested ways
    to bypass it, and show why those approaches are vulnerable. Assume for example that you
    are given an unknown quantum bit [|\Psi&gt;=\alpha |0&gt; + \beta |1&gt;] and you are
    expected to measure it either in the computational basis, |0&gt; versus |1&gt;, or the
    diagonal basis, (|0&gt; + |1&gt;)/\sqrt{2}versus (|0&gt; - |1&gt;)/\sqrt{2}. You could
    cheat the protocol if only you could postpone the choice of basis (and therefore the
    measurement) until after subsequent classical information becomes available. To prevent
    this, you are asked to use a classical (perhaps multi-party) commitment scheme to commit
    to your choice of basis (computational or diagonal) as well as to the result of your
    measurement. Then, either you are immediately challenged to open those commitments to
    &quot;prove'' that you had measured, in which case this quantum bit is not used any
    further, or you are allowed to keep secret your choice of basis and measurement result for
    later use. The hope was that this approach could turn a classical bit commitment scheme
    that is reasonably secure for a very short time into a quantum bit commitment scheme that
    is permanently secure. Unfortunately, it turns out that you can always postpone measuring
    the quantum bit and offer fake commitments even if you are unable to break the underlying
    commitment scheme in the time that elapses between the commitment and the challenge: if a
    challenge comes, you can open your &quot;commitments'' in a way consistent with what you
    would have committed to had you measured the quantum bit, and if the challenge does not
    come, you can keep the quantum bit intact for later measurement in the basis of your
    choice.</td>

    Quantum physics tells us that, in principle, one can manipulate quantum bits (two-level
    systems, now called simply <em>qubits</em>). One can store them and send them, initialize
    and measure their state, transform their state, each one alone, or a few together.
    Unfortunately, quantum physics does not tell us how to do these basic operations, and as
    yet, there is no suggestion of a system where all these steps can be done. Recent research
    shows that if qubits can be suitably manipulated, then a new form of computer and
    information sciences is created, where teleportation, ultra-fast quantum algorithms, and
    secure quantum key distribution are the main promises. While performing all the basic
    steps is still impossible, a number of specific proposals, where particular simple tasks
    can be implemented, have emerged. Many of these caused a considerable controversy since
    the advantages of using qubits are easily lost when the qubits are not implemented
    carefully, as in one of the examples I show here. I shall give a detailed description of
    implementing a quantum key distribution scheme. The implemented &quot;qubits'' are usually
    not true two-level systems, and as a result, the existing experimental schemes (based on
    weak pulses) become <em>totally</em> insecure in the presence of high channel loss rate! I
    will present another potential implementation: qubits generated using a process of
    parametric downconversion, to show that it is much more promising.</td>
