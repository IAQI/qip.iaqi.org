Do Quantum Drunks Walk Faster?

</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD>Finite Markov Chains have algorithmic applications in many areas,
  where the efficiency of the algorithm depends crucially on the
  mixing time. Can Quantum walks mix faster than Random walks?

<P>
We define quantum walks on finite graphs. An interesting question is
  how to capture the notion of mixing time in such processes; Quantum
  walks are unitary, and therefore we cannot expect convergence to a
  stationary distribution. Nevertheless, the notion of <I>quantum
    mixing time</I> can be defined, which captures the speed at which
  the process evolves.

<P>
We show that for the quantum walk on a circle of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>, the
  quantum mixing time is almost quadratically faster than its
  classical analogue.  On the other hand, we prove a lower bound,
  showing that for any graph, a quantum walk can mix at most
  polynomially faster than its classical analogue.

<P>

A New Protocol and Lower Bounds for Quantum Coin Flipping

<DD>Alice and Bob want to flip a coin but they do not trust one another.
  They want to have a protocol that
  
<UL>
<LI>would produce each of two results (0 and 1) with probability
    1/2 each if both Alice and Bob follow the protocol
</LI>
<LI>if one of them follows the protocol but the other does not,

  Mayers, Salvail and Chiba-Kohno showed that there is no quantum
  protocol that achieves <!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

  new results about quantum coin flipping.

<P>
First, I will show a simple quantum protocol for coin flipping in
  which no cheating party can achieve one outcome (0 or 1) with
  probability more than 0.75. This is the best provable result known
  and it improves the previous 0.91...of Aharonov, Ta-Shma,
  Vazirani and Yao (STOC'00.) I will also show that the new protocol
  is optimal for a restricted class of protocols.

<P>
Second, I will show a general lower bound on how good can be
  protocols that are restricted to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> messages between Alice and Bob.
  This bound implies that, to decrease the bias <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$ \epsilon$"></SPAN>, one needs
  to increase the number of messages (rounds), not just exchange a lot
  of qubits in few rounds.

<DD>It is possible to ``know'' or ``possess'' a quantum state in
  infinitely many physically inequivalent ways, ranging from complete
  classical knowledge, through possession of a single specimen of
  the state, to weaker and less compactly embodiable forms such as the
  ability to simulate the outcome of a single POVM measurement on the
  state.  A less well understood hierarchy of degrees of knowledge or
  possession holds for unitary operations and completely positive
  maps.

<DT></DT>
<DD>Can entanglement be used to save on classical communication?  It is
  well-known that entanglement on its own is useless for the
  transmission of information.  Yet, there are distributed tasks that
  cannot be accomplished at all in a classical world when
  communication is not allowed, but that become possible if the
  non-communicating parties share prior entanglement.  This leads to
  wondering how expensive it is, in terms of classical communication,
  to provide an exact simulation of the spooky power of entanglement.

<P>
We show that a small constant number of bits of communication is
  sufficient to simulate the effect of a single bit of entanglement,
  but exponentially many bits of communication are required to
  simulate the effect of several bits of entanglement.  Therefore,
  quantum entanglement can always be traded for classical
  communication, but the cost may be prohibitive.

<DT></DT>
<DD>We give new bounds on the circuit complexity of the quantum Fourier
  transform (QFT). We give an upper bound of O(log <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> + log log 1/<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$ \epsilon$"></SPAN>) on
  the circuit depth for computing an approximation of the QFT with
  respect to the modulus <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<SUP>n</SUP></SPAN> with error bounded by epsilon. Thus,
  even for exponentially small error, our circuits have depth
  O(log <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>).  The best previous depth
  bound was O(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>), even for approximations
  with constant error.  Moreover, our circuits have size
  O(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> log
    (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>/<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

<P>
As an application of the above depth bound, we show that Shor's
  factoring algorithm may be based on quantum circuits with depth only
  O(log <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>) and polynomial size, in
  combination with classical polynomial-time pre- and post-processing.

<P>
Next, we prove an <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$ \Omega$"></SPAN>(log <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>)
  lower bound on the depth complexity of approximations of the QFT
  with constant error.  This implies that the above upper bound is
  asymptotically tight (for a reasonable range of values of
  <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$ \epsilon$"></SPAN>).

<P>
We also give an upper bound of O(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> (log <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>)<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN> log log <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>) on the circuit size of
  the exact QFT modulo <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<SUP>n</SUP></SPAN>, for which the best previous bound was
  O(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN>).

<P>
Finally, based on our circuits for the QFT with power-of-2 moduli,
  we show that the QFT with respect to an arbitrary modulus <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> can be
  approximated with accuracy <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

<DD>We introduce the Shifted Legendre Symbol Problem and some variants
  along with efficient quantum algorithms to solve them. The problems
  and their algorithms are different from previous work on quantum
  computation in that they do not appear to fit into the framework of
  the Hidden Subgroup Problem. The classical complexity of the problem
  is unknown despite the various results on the irregularity of
  Legendre Sequences.

</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD>Both remote state preparation (RSP) and quantum teleportation have
  the same goal, to transmit a quantum state using prior entanglement
  and classical communication.  But in RSP, the sender has full
  classical knowledge of the state to be transmitted.  This knowledge
  permits RSP to use less resources than teleportation, in which both
  one ebit and two classical bits are necessary to send a qubit.  RSP
  exhibits a non-trivial tradeoff between the use of entanglement and
  classical bit resources.  On one end of this tradeoff, we show that
  the asymptotic classical communication cost of RSP can be reduced to
  one bit per qubit, half of that of teleportation, if about 4 ebits
  can be consumed.  At the other end, if a large number of bits <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
  can be used, the ebit cost goes like <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I>2<SUP>-n</SUP></SPAN>.  We will also
  introduce a new capacity, an RSP capacity, for a general quantum
  channel, and consider RSP for parts of entangled states.

<DT></DT>
<DD>Quantum adiabatic evolution is the basis of a new class of quantum
  algorithms for combinatorial search problems.  This method is
  guaranteed to work if the running time of the algorithm is long
  enough.  In general it is difficult to determine the required
  running time.  In certain special cases of classically easy problems
  it can be shown that the required running time grows only
  polynomially in the number of bits.  I will present encouraging
  numerical results on randomly generated instances of the NP-complete
  problem Exact Cover.  I will also present similarly encouraging
  results for the time required to find the largest clique in a random
  graph.

<DT></DT>
<DD>We extend algorithmic information theory to quantum mechanics, with
  a universal semicomputable density matrix (``apriori probability'')
  as a starting point, and define complexity (an operator) as its
  negative logarithm.

<P>
A number of properties of Kolmogorov complexity extend naturally to
  the new domain.  Approximately, a quantum state is simple if it is
  within a small distance from a low-dimensional subspace of low
  Kolmogorov complexity.  The von Neumann entropy of a computable
  density matrix is within an additive constant from the average
  complexity.  Some of the theory of randomness translates to the new
  domain.

<P>
We explore the relations of the new quantity to the quantum
  Kolmogorov complexity defined by Vit&#225;nyi (we show that the latter
  is sometimes as large as <!-- MATH
 $2n - 2\log n$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>n</I> - 2 log&nbsp;<I>n</I></SPAN>) and the qubit complexity
  defined by Berthiaume, van Dam, and Laplante.  With respect to cloning,
  our complexity behaves similarly to the latter one.

Quantum Ordered Searching

<DD>Any comparison-based classical algorithm for searching an ordered
  set of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> items requires at least <SPAN CLASS="MATH">log<SUB>2</SUB>(<I>N</I>)</SPAN> comparisons.  The
  celebrated binary search algorithm meets this bound, and its
  behavior can be illustrated by a binary tree.  Each node of the tree
  is labelled by a comparison, and each leaf by one of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> items.
  Initially, the state of the algorithm is represented by the root of
  the tree, and at each step of the algorithm, a comparison determines
  whether we go to the left or right child.  Eventually, the walk ends
  at a leaf, which represents the result of the algorithm.

<P>
We give a quantum version of this classical binary search algorithm.
  The algorithm initiates several independent walks at the root, each
  walk advancing down the tree at its own speed.  Then, instead of
  having each walk advancing only (at most) 1 node at each step, we
  give a routine that allows them to cooperate.  Two walks that are at
  neighboring nodes (which must be in a parent-child relation) can, by
  cooperating, jump simultaneously to the same child, hereby advancing
  1 and 2 nodes, respectively.  Having a routine that allows 1 walk to
  advance 1 node, while another walk advances 2 nodes, yields, after
  taking care of details, a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">log<SUB>3</SUB>(<I>N</I>)</SPAN> exact quantum algorithm for
  ordered searching.

<P>
Our quantum algorithm can be implemented in parts by the quantum
  version of the Haar transform, which is the most basic wavelet
  transform.  We find this to be an interesting aspect since most
  existing quantum algorithms are based primarily on quantum Fourier
  transforms and amplitude amplification.  Little in our algorithm
  seems to render impossible similar enhanced quantum versions of
  other classical algorithms based on graphs.

<P>
The currently best known upper bound for exact ordered searching is
  roughly <!-- MATH

 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">0.526 log<SUB>2</SUB>(<I>N</I>)</SPAN>, due to Farhi, Goldstone, Gutmann, and

 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1/<IMG

  |<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>&gt; having prior probabilities <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>.
  By analogy with classical information theory we may think of the
  ``quantum information content'' of the source operationally as the
  least number of qubits/signal needed to faithfully encode long
  sequences of signals emitted by the source.  According to
  Schumacher's quantum source coding theorem this is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> qubits/signal
  where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> is the von Neumann entropy of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN>.

<P>
Now we may think of classical information as a separate kind of
  resource and ask a more probing question: to what extent can the
  quantum information of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN> be faithfully encoded into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>
  qubits/signal and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> classical bits/signal in such a way that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>
  is minimised while <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> may be as large as desired? Our main result
  is that the minimal <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> in this scenario is still <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> (assuming that
  the signal states do not fall into two or more orthogonal
  subspaces). Thus in this sense, quantum information is fully robust
  against classicization.

<P>
In this talk we will discuss various aspects of this result
  including some interesting information-disturbance relations that
  are needed in the proof and some remaining open questions.

<DD>Protocols for performing distributed quantum computation can be
  modified into protocols for creating entanglement between the
  parties performing the computation.  I explain how the amount of
  entanglement created by the modified protocol can be used to obtain
  non-trivial lower bounds on the quantum communication complexity of
  classical functions, and of quantum operations such as the quantum
  Fourier transform.

<DD>I derive a non-trivial lower bound for the decrease of the relative
  entropy under partial trace given that one of the density operators
  is non-distillable. After proving this inequality using operator
  monotonicity of the logarithm and the reduction criterion I move on
  to some interpretations of the inequality and finally I present a
  number of its applications. These applications include lower bounds
  on entanglement measures, bounds on the capacity of superdense
  coding and bounds of multi-partite entanglement measures in terms of
  bipartite entanglement measures .

Private Quantum Channels and Quantum Authentication

<DT></DT>
<DD>In 1949 Claude Shannon published one of the most important papers in
  cryptography, ``Communication theory of secrecy systems.'' In this
  paper he shows that in order to achieve perfect secrecy in a private
  key cryptosystem the entropy of the private key must be as large as
  the length of the message to be transmitted secretly.  Combined with
  the one-time pad (Vernam cipher) we obtain that in order to encrypt
  an <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>-bit message, a private key of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> random bits is necessary
  and sufficient.

<P>
What about the transmission of quantum messages ?  Is it possible in
  this case to perform encryption using a finite secret key ?  The
  answer to this question is trivially yes.  It requires actually a key
  of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>n</I></SPAN> secret bits to encrypt <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> qubits.  In this talk, I will
  discuss this issue and also show that <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>n</I></SPAN> bits of key are
  necessary.

<P>
Another important question in quantum cryptography is the
  authentication of quantum messages. I will sketch some very recent
  result on this topic.  I will present a protocol to code a quantum
  message using a finite private key in such a way that it is possible
  for the receiver (possibly the sender in the future) to perform a
  test such that if it succeeds then the fidelity of the transmitted
  state is exponentially close to the original state except with
  exponentially small probability.  That is, if a malicious player
  tries to forge a message or even only to modify the content of a
  message, he will be caught with probability exponentially close to 1.

<DD>One of two orthogonal, bipartite quantum states are distributed to
  Alice and Bob.  Can they distinguish which of the two they have
  received by doing local quantum operations along with classical
  communications?  It has recently been shown that if the quantum
  states are pure, such states can be perfectly distinguished.  But we
  now show mixed states about which Alice and Bob can obtain no
  information by LOCC operations.  These states have two descriptions,
  either as mixtures of collections of Bell states with a definite
  singlet parity, or as particular examples of Werner states.  The
  proof of this result will be outlined.  Possible applications to bit
  commitment will be explored.

<DD>In my talk I will review the notion of classical and quantum
  correlations and show how these concepts can be applied to analysing
  quantum algorithms. In particular, I will discuss Grover's search
  algorithm from this perspective. I show that, surprisingly,
  classical correlations play a more prominent role in determining the
  speed-up in this algorithm than does entanglement. I then analyse
  Shor's algorithm and the presence (or absence) of classical and
  quantum correlation between and inside the registers during the
  entire computation. This approach will provide a basis for analysing
  the efficiency of quantum computation with mixed states.

<DD>In this talk I will present polynomial-time quantum algorithms for

  problems of computing the order of solvable groups, testing
  membership in solvable groups, and testing isomorphism of two
  solvable groups.  The algorithms work in the setting of black-box
  groups, wherein it has been proved that none of the above problems
  can be solved classically in polynomial time.  While the algorithms
  rely heavily on Shor's algorithm, these problems do not appear to
  reduce to problems that can be solved in the context of the Abelian
  Hidden Subgroup problem.

<DD>Classical hashing associates with a string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> a shorter string
  <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>h</I><SUB>x</SUB></SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>'s <EM>fingerprint</EM>), such that with high probability,
  <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> are equal if and only if their fingerprints <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>h</I><SUB>x</SUB></SPAN> and
  <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>h</I><SUB>y</SUB></SPAN> are equal.  The fingerprints can be exponentially smaller than
  the original strings if the party making <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>h</I><SUB>x</SUB></SPAN> and the party making
  <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>h</I><SUB>y</SUB></SPAN> share randomness, but not if they are uncorrelated.  If we
  allow the fingerprints to consist of qubits, then such fingerprints
  <EM>can</EM> be made to work even without any correlations between the
  parties.  We give a scheme where the quantum fingerprint
  |<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>h</I><SUB>x</SUB></SPAN>&gt; is easy to construct and
  exponentially shorter than the original string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>, and we give a
  test which distinguishes any two such (unknown) quantum fingerprints
  from each other with high probability.  We also derive nearly tight
  bounds on the optimal achievable success probability when <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> copies
  of both fingerprints are given.

<P>
We give two applications of this quantum fingerprinting scheme.
  Firstly, in the variant of communication complexity known as
  ``simultaneous message passing'', we give an exponential
  quantum-classical gap for the equality function.  Secondly, we show
  that quantum data structures for representing very sparse sets can
  be made exponentially smaller than classical data structures
  representing those sets.
