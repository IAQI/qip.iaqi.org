<font color="red"><strong>Special notes from the PC of QIP2015</strong></font><br>
-	From September 13 (after submission deadline for contributed talks) to October 20 (notification of acceptance for contributed talks), the EasyChair server will be closed to submissions. A  server will be re-opened to additional poster submissions during the period October 21-25. (Previous submitted abstracts labeled as “talk, if not accepted then poster” or “poster only” do not need to be re-submitted; they will automatically be considered for posters.)<br>
<br>
-	Extended abstracts of accepted talks and posters will be posted at the QIP2015 website (this is a service to the community but does not count as a publication). Please email the final version of your extended abstract (in pdf) to <a href="mailto:qip2015-abstract@quantum-lab.org">qip2015-abstract@quantum-lab.org</a> as an attachment. Please use "QIP2015 Final Extended Abstract Submission" as the email subject, and provide in the main text of your email the following required information: 1) submission id in EasyChair; 2) full list of authors; 3) submission title, and 4) type of the abstract (talk or poster). Optional information such as arXiv identifier, URL of the full paper, and URL of authors (or email addresses), are also welcome. The submission deadline for the final version is <strong>November 25, 2014</strong>. <br>

<p id="content">
<strong>Abstract submission for contributed talks</strong><br>

Contributed talks at QIP are intended to be representative of outstanding recent research contributions to the theory of quantum information and computation. Submissions to QIP for talks should consist of an extended abstract of at most 3 pages, containing a non-technical, clear, and insightful description of the results and main ideas, their potential impact, and their importance to quantum information and computation. (Extended abstracts should not consist of a compressed version of a full paper, but instead should facilitate an intuitive understanding of the research results they represent and help the program committee in assessing their importance.) Extended abstracts must be submitted in PDF format, and be typeset in single-column form with reasonable margins and font size at least 11 points. The 3 page limit on submissions does not include references. Submissions deviating from these guidelines may be rejected without consideration of their merits. In addition to the extended abstract, each submission is allowed to refer to a technical version of the work, either posted to an online repository, such as arXiv.org, or submitted as an attachment. (Referral to an online repository is strongly preferred.) The program committee will consider technical versions of submissions at its discretion only. <br><br>
Starting from this QIP, submissions whose main authors are students might be eligible for the QIP Best Student Paper Prize. See <a href="Submission.php.html#prize">here</a> for eligibility criteria for this prize.

<div id="prize"><h4 id="content"><strong>QIP Best Student Paper Prize</strong> </h4></div>
<p id="content">
A submission is eligible for the student prize if and only if the main author(s) is/are a student(s) at the time of the submission and will present the work at QIP, and further a significant portion of the work (at least 60%) must have been done by said student(s), including the majority of the key ideas. Eligibility can only be indicated at the time of submission. All authors are notified if their paper has been labelled as eligible for the student prize, and have 14 days following submission to voice any disagreements about the paper's nomination to the PC chair. The PC chair is free to ask for any clarifications regarding the students' contributions at any time.
