Shor's algorithm for factorization and 
Grover's algorithm 
for table lookup are no doubt among  
the most important results in quantum algorithms.
In this presentation, we will show how to use ideas coming 
from these two algorithms to perform a completely novel task.
Suppose a function F is given as a black box, 
one can find an x for which F(x)=1 much more efficiently with Grover's
algorithm than with any classical technique. 
Now suppose one wants to evaluate the size of 
{x|F(x)=1}, that is, to count the number of solutions to F. 
We will present an algorithm that can approximate this size 
with a selected accuracy.
<P>

Let P be the number of calls to the function F, 
N the size of the domain of F, t 
the size of {x|F(x)=1}  and 
t' our estimate of t. 
For selected values of P, which is a good indicator of the time
avalaible for computation, we have the following results.
<P>

<UL>
<LI>If we take P=c N^(1/2) then |t'-t|< (2 Pi t^(1/2))/c + (Pi^2)/(c^2).

<LI>For P=c(N/t)^(1/2) we have (1+Pi/c)^2 <  t'/t < 1/(1+Pi/c)^2.
<LI>Finally with P=c(t'N)^(1/2) we have t'=t with bounded probability.
</UL>

Of course, the algorithm does not need any prior information 
about t. The number of evaluations of F needed to obtain 
the selected precision is quite lower than 
the best possible sampling algorithm. This technique is also more 
efficient than naive classical uses of Grover's algorithm.
<P>

The basic ideas regarding the algorithm we will present 
have been exposed in section 5 of [1].  
The final version is in progress.

<STRONG><CENTER>Abstract</CENTER></STRONG><br><br>
We address the question of understanding quantum algorithms in 
terms of unitary operators.  Many quantum algorithms can be 
expressed as applications of operators formed by conjugating 
so-called classical operators.  The operators that are used for 
conjugation are determined by the problem and any additional 
structure possessed by the Hilbert space that is acted upon.
  We prove many new commutative laws between these different
operators, and we use those to phrase and analyze old and new 
problems and algorithms.  As an example, we review the Abelian 
subgroup problem.  We then introduce the problem of determining 
a group homomorphism, and we give classical and quantum algorithms 
for it.  We also generalize Deutsch's problem and improve the 
previous best algorithms for earlier generalizations of it.

<STRONG><CENTER>Abstract</CENTER></STRONG><br><br>
Quantum computing has a large advantage over traditional probabilistic approaches because of "interference", the ability of "bad" computation paths to cancel each other leaving the "good" computation paths with a higher probability of occurrence.

A similar phenomenon developed in the study of counting complexity several years ago. Counting complexity looks at not just whether a certain search problem has a solution, but rather at the number of solutions. Valiant first looked at these questions, developing the #P functions, which count the number of accepting paths of NP machines. A whole area of study quickly developed studying #P functions and many complexity classes based on these functions.

In order to help understand the power of counting classes, Fenner, Fortnow and Kurtz developed the GapP functions, which are the class of #P functions closed under subtraction. One can view GapP functions as putting positive and negative weights on the computation paths of an NP machine. This yields a cancellation effect not unlike the one we see with quantum machines. Also, GapP has some wonderful closure properties that give us powerful tools for studying their behavior.

In this survey talk, we will give a brief history and sampling of results about GapP functions. We then will present a surprisingly tight connection between GapP functions and Quantum Turing machines. We describe two recent results using this connection:

- (Fortnow-Rogers) BQP sits in a previously studied complexity class AWPP. This result gives an easy proof that BQP is in PP and in fact shows that BQP is low for PP, i.e. PP with a BQP oracle is still PP. This also leads to new relativized results about BQP.
- (Fenner-Green-Homer-Pruim) An exact characterization of NQP as the well-studied complexity class co-C=P.

reduced to a single execution of <STRONG>UOT(X,Y)</STRONG> with Bob's knowledge <STRONG>Y</STRONG>
restricted in terms of min-entropy and R&eacute;nyi entropy of order <STRONG>&micro;>1</STRONG>.
For independently repeated <STRONG>UOT</STRONG> the reduction works even if only Bob's

<STRONG><CENTER>Abstract</CENTER></STRONG><br><br>
Many algorithmic developments in quantum complexity theory, including
Shor's celebrated algorithms for factoring and discrete logs, have
made use of Fourier transforms over abelian groups.  That is, at
some point in the computation, the machine is in a superposition of
states corresponding to elements of a finite abelian group $G$, and
in quantum polynomial time (i.e., polynomial in $\log|G|$),
the machine is transformed according to
the Fourier transform to a superposition of states corresponding to
the irreducible representations of $G$.  We give a quantum
polynomial time algorithm for the Fourier transform for the 
symmetric groups $S_n$, adapting results obtained by Clausen and
Diaconis--Rockmore to the quantum setting.

<STRONG><CENTER>Abstract</CENTER></STRONG><br><br>
Non-locality is one of the astonishing phenomena in quantum
mechanics. Well-known examples are EPR pairs and the GHZ state. One
common feature of these states is that the non-local properties do not
change under local transformations, i. e., unitary operations acting
independently on each of the subsystems. The error-correcting
properties of quantum codes do not change under local transformations,
too.

Any function that is invariant under local transformations can be used
to describe these non-local properties. We focus on polynomials that
are invariant under local transformations. Our work extends the
results of Eric Rains on polynomial invariants of quantum codes.

Rains showed that for an N-qubit-system there is a correspondence
between N-tuples of permutations of k letters and homogeneous
invariants of degree k. We will present a construction for homogeneous
invariants that is based on labeled binary trees. This reduces the
upper bound for the running time to find all invariants of degree k
from (k!)^N to (2^k)^N.

We will present further conditions that allow a reduction of the
number of permutations that need to be considered. This makes the
computation of all invariants feasible at least for small degree and
few qubits.

For the smallest example, a two-qubit system, we computed the Molien
series that encodes the number of linearly independent homogeneous
invariants for each degree. Combining our algorithm with this series,
we computed a system of 21 invariants for which we were able to show
that it generates all invariants up to degree 23. We conjecture that
all invariants can be generated by those invariants.

In this talk, the relative power of quantum and classical (probabilistic)
machines, when the limiting resource is space rather than time, will be
discussed.  In particular, quantum simulations of probabilistic machines and
probabilistic simulations of quantum machines will be presented which imply
the following relationships for any suitable (space constructible and not
sub-logarithmic) space bound s:

(1) Any PTM which runs in space s and which halts absolutely (i.e. for each
input, there exists some finite number of steps after which the machine halts
with certainty) can be simulated in space O(s) by a QTM.  If the PTM has
probability of error bounded away from 1/2, or has one-sided error, the same
is true of the QTM.  In the case of unbounded error, the quantum machine may
be taken to halt absolutely, but for the bounded error and one-sided error
cases the QTM will not necessarily halt absolutely.

(2) Any QTM running in space s can be simulated by an unbounded error PTM
running in space O(s).  No assumptions on the probability of error or running
time for the QTM are required, but it is assumed that all transition
amplitudes of the QTM are rational.

It follows that unbounded error, space O(s) bounded QTMs and PTMs (with
rational transition amplitudes/probabilities) are equivalent in power, and
that QTMs can be simulated deterministically with at most quadratic increase
in space.  Quantum analogues of nondeterministic space-bounded classes, where
acceptance or rejection is determined by whether QTMs accept with nonzero or
zero probability, will also be mentioned.  A result analogous to a recent
result of [Fenner, Green, Homer and Pruim] holds for these space-bounded
classes: quantum-NSPACE(s) = co-C=SPACE(s).

Quantum entanglement cannot be used to simulate communication among remote parties, 
but it can reduce the communication needed for some problems. Let each out of 
<EM>k</EM> parties hold some partial input data to some fixed <EM>k</EM>-variable function <EM>f</EM>. 
The communication complexity of <EM>f</EM> is the minimum number of classical bits required 
to be broadcasted for every party to know the value of <EM>f</EM> on their inputs.
We show that, for a particular function <STRONG>F</STRONG>, if the parties share prior quantum 
entanglement, then the communication complexity of <STRONG>F</STRONG> is exactly <EM>k</EM>. On the other 
hand, we also show that, if no entangled particles are provided, then the classical 
communication complexity of <STRONG>F</STRONG> is roughly <EM>k</EM>log<SUB>2</SUB> <EM>k</EM>. 
In terms of the number of 
parties, this proves for the first time a communication complexity separation better 
than a constant number of bits.

Quantum Bit Commitment from a Physical Assumption
</A>

<em>Authors:</em><STRONG>Louis Salvail</STRONG> [ BRICS,<EM><SPACER TYPE=horizontal SIZE=5>salvail@brics.dk</EM>]
<br>
 <BR><BR><BR> 
<STRONG><CENTER>Abstract</CENTER></STRONG><br><br>
Bit commitment is a basic and fundamental cryptographic tool allowing
a sender to give a piece of evidence that she has a bit <STRONG>x</STRONG>
in mind. The receiver does not learn the bit from
the information he receives but can ask the sender to
unveil it. A secure bit commitment scheme
must be
<UL>
<LI> <EM>hidding</EM>:the receiver cannot learn the bit from the piece of evidence,
<LI> <EM>binding</EM>:the sender has only one choice when she unveils.
</UL>
A weaker but usefull bit commitment scheme is obtained
by relaxing the binding condition. We say that such a scheme is
<STRONG>d</STRONG>-<EM>binding</EM> if for any execution 
of the commiting phase
 there exists
a bit <STRONG>w</STRONG> such that the revelation of <STRONG>w</STRONG> has
 probability of success less than
<STRONG>d</STRONG>. Any <STRONG>d</STRONG>-binding
commitment scheme, 
with <STRONG>d</STRONG>&lt;1,
is sufficient in order to build a secure
quantum oublivious transfer protocol with no significant increase in 
communication complexity.<BR><BR>
 
However, Mayers has shown that quantum mechanics does not allow
secure bit commitment schemes under the only assumption
that quantum mechanics is correct. This no-go theorem is
also valid for <STRONG>d</STRONG>-binding commitment
schemes. If the 
quantum states ensemble describing the 
commitment of <STRONG>x</STRONG>=0 is nearly the same
as the one describing the commitment of <STRONG>x</STRONG>=1, 
thus the commitment is hidding,
then both bits can be unveiled
with no possibility of detection.
Although the attack can always be carried out in principle,
it requires to run a quantum computer storing
large entanglements during the time between the committing
and the revelation phases.<BR><BR>

In this talk, we assume that one party, the sender, cannot
deal with arbitrarily large quantum states. Namely, there exists
a limit <STRONG>t</STRONG><SUP>*</SUP> on the number of photons (or q-bits) that
can be measured coherently (a measurement
involving no more than <STRONG>t</STRONG><SUP>*</SUP> of
the received q-bits is called
a <STRONG>t</STRONG><SUP>*</SUP>-coherent measurement). 
We show that under
this extra assumption secure quantum bit commitment is possible
for quite large values of <STRONG>t</STRONG><SUP>*</SUP>. 
In particular, we describe a <STRONG>d</STRONG>-binding
quantum bit commitment scheme
secure against any <STRONG>t</STRONG><SUP>*</SUP>-coherent measurement
provided <STRONG>t</STRONG><SUP>*</SUP>&lt; &micro;<STRONG>N</STRONG> for
&micro;&gt;0 and <STRONG>N</STRONG> is 
the number  photons transmitted
during the committing phase.  As a corollary,
the scheme is 2<SUP>-a<STRONG>N</STRONG></SUP>-binding
against any <STRONG>t</STRONG><SUP>*</SUP>-coherent measurement
provided <STRONG>t</STRONG><SUP>*</SUP> &lt;
&micro;<STRONG>N</STRONG><SUP>1/2</SUP>
for some &micro;&gt;0.

Entanglement is perhaps the most non-classical aspect of quantum mechanics.
It is the soul of quantum teleportation and without it no nontrivial quantum
computation would be possible.  However, sharing long-lived entanglement
between two distant observers is technologically challenging because of
the fragility of quantum information, both in transit and through time.

I shall explain how it is possible for two observers to purify an initial
supply of imperfect entanglement, possibly obtained through a noisy quantum
channel, by means of local operations and the exchange of classical information.
This technique can be used to assist in the faithful transmission of quantum
information over an unreliable quantum channel, and it may also have
applications in quantum cryptography.

We present a simple and general simulation technique that transforms any
black-box quantum algorithm ({\it \`a la} Grover's database search algorithm)
to a quantum communication protocol for a related problem, in a way
that fully exploits the quantum parallelism. 

We construct novel  quantum communication protocols that 
are built from nontrivial quantum algorithms via this simulation.
These protocols, combined with (old and new) classical lower bounds, 
are shown to provide the first asymptotic separation results between
the quantum and classical (probabilistic) two-party communication 
complexity models.
In particular, we obtain a quadratic separation for the bounded-error 
models, and an exponential separation for the zero-error models.

We derive computational lower bounds for the PARITY and MAJORITY 
function in the black-box model which demonstrate that these problems 
cannot be solved significantly faster by quantum algorithms than by 
classical algorithms. In particular, the kind of quadratic speed-up 
achieved by Grover's quantum technique for the OR function is impossible

bounds are derived from lower bounds in communication complexity.
We also describe black-box algorithms that compute bounded-depth

Validation of a presumably universal theory, such as quantum mechanics, requires a quantum mechanical description 
of systems that carry out theoretical calculations and systems that carry out experiments.  The description of
quantum computers is under active development.  No description of systems to carry out experiments has been given.
A small step in this direction is taken here by giving a description of quantum robots as mobile systems with on 
board quantum computers that interact with different environments of quantum systems.  Some properties of these 
systems are discussed.  A specific model based on the literature descriptions of quantum Turing machines is 
presented.

We will analyze to what extent quantum 
operations can be simulated efficiently by using 
mixed state environments instead of pure states. We 
will present numerical counterexamples that indicate 
that operations on qubits cannot always be simulated with a 
mixed single qubit environment. For the class of generalized 
depolarizing channels we show how a qutrit environment 
does suffice.

To date perhaps the most illuminating formulation of known quantum
algorithms is the Abelian Hidden Subgroup Problem.  This framework
includes both Simon's and Shor's results and casts these algorithms in a
group-theoretic framework which both reveals the fundamental role of the
Fourier transorm and indicates new research directions.  Indeed a most
natural question is if the hidden subgroups of noncommutative groups may
be found efficiently by quantum computers.  This question is all the more
urgent given the fact that graph isomorphism reduces to it and Beals has
already supplied the appropriate quantum fourier transform over the
symmetric group.  However harmonic analysis is more complex in the
noncommutative case which makes this a challenging research problem.  We
will investigate the noncommutative hidden subgroup problem.  We will
review the general duality results known as Tannaka-Krejn duality,
illustrate the necessity of new techniques by showing the limitations of
the commutative methods in the case of several semidirect products, and 
provide evidence that the noncommutative hidden subgroup problem is
solvable for Gelfand Pairs.

Protocols devised in the classical scenario are generally believed
to retain their security properties when considered in the context
of quantum computers. We show this belief is wrong. We demonstrate 
that some computational bit commitment schemes proven secure in the 
classical scenario are really useless in the quantum scenario.
More precisely, we show that bit commitment schemes that are
unconditionally concealing such as the computationally binding
protocol due to Naor,Ostrovsky,Venkatasen,Yung or the
two-prover protocol of Ben-Or,Goldwasser,Kilian,Wigderson can be 
cheated efficiently with a quantum computer, when these schemes are
used to commit to the outcome of a quantum measurement.
We use these results to defeat attempts to implement unconditional
quantum bit commitment by bootstrapping with such schemes.

How much information can one touch in k qbits ?

<P>
Holevo's theorem states that k qbits can transmit at most k classical bits of
information. Yet, it does not rule out the possibility that only one bit of 
information is obtained, BUT OF OUR CHOICE. 
Thus we ask is it possible that one can encode n classical bits x_1...x_n 
into k qbits, with k much smaller than n, s.t. 
for any 1 \le i \le n, there is a
measurement that for any encoded word v=v(x) recovers the i'th bit of x, 
x_i, with success probability at least delta=1/2+epsilon (\epsilon > 0). 
We call such a scheme an
n->k encoding with success probability delta (and epsilon advantage). 

<P>
A simple example shows that a 2->1 encoding with success probability of 
0.86.. exists, while no
2->1 probabilistic encoding can achieve any positive advantage. 
In fact, even a 3->1 encoding with 0.79 success probability exists. 
This naturally raises the question of
the asymptotic behavior of such encodings. 

<P>
A simple information theoretic argument shows that any n->m probabilistic 
encoding with success probability delta requires
m to be at least (1-H(delta))n, where H is the Shannon entropy function. 
Thus, in the probabilistic model, if we want constant advantage, m must be a 
constant fraction of n. 
The information theoretic argument, as it is, does not extend to the quantum 
model where a bit is learnt by a measurement, and a measurement causes 
unrecoverable
destruction to the given code-word. 
Yet, we present a proof that even in the quantum world, 
there is no way to encode n -> n/clog(n) with a constant advantage. Our
proof also covers a quantum encoder that given an input x, 
has a probability distribution over k-qbit code-words. 

<P>
One notable variant of the problem which is not covered
by our proof, is the variant where we replace the requirement 
"for any v=v(x) and for any 1 \le i \le n" with the weaker requirement 
"for any v=v(x), for MOST 1 \le i \le n".
We do not know yet whether this is a technical detail, 
to be fixed by a better proof, 
or not. 
We point out that this might have implications to a new class we define, which
we call QNP (for "QUANTUM NP").

Unconditional security means a security against all attacks. There has been several claims of
security in the past.  The presented work is different because it is the only one that carefully
considers all attacks.  The essential of the proof was first published by Mayers in Crypto96.  It

<STRONG><CENTER>Abstract</CENTER></STRONG><br><br>
There are several well known quantum algorithms which represent a substantial speedup over 
any known classical algorithm for the corresponding problem. This leads to the question of 
understanding precisely what the essential quantum physical effect is, that gives rise to
this computational facility and why it cannot occur within classical physics.
<P>
We give an analysis of the fast fourier transform algorithm as implemented in the quantum 
context and relate its exponential speedup to specific properties of quantum entanglement 
(which have been summarised in [1]). These properties appear to underlie all of the known 
quantum algorithms and apply to FFT algorithms over general abelian groups.
<P>
The above properties of entanglement do not exhaust all the ways in which quantum physics 
differs from classical physics. We consider the question of whether there are other 
different quantum effects which may be exploited for novel computational possibilities.
We describe the example of ``counterfactual quantum computation'' -- a quantum mechanical 
method of learning the result of a computation without running the computer. It is based
on properties of quantum measurement and relates to some vexing interpretational issues.

A quantum computer has a clear advantage over a classical computer for exhaustive search.
The quantum mechanical algorithm for exhaustive search was originally derived by using
subtle properties of a particular quantum mechanical operation called the Walsh-Hadamard
(W-H) transform. This paper shows that this algorithm can be implemented by replacing the
W-H transform by almost any quantum mechanical operation. This leads to several new
applications where it improves the number of steps by a square-root. It also broadens the
scope for implementation since it demonstrates quantum mechanical algorithms that can
readily adapt to available technology.

Security of quantum key distribution against sophisticated attacks
is among the most important issues in quantum information theory.
We prove security against a very important class of attacks
called <em>collective attacks</em> which use quantum memories and
gates, and which are directed against the final key.
Although attacks stronger than the collective attacks can exist
in principle, no explicit example was found and it is conjectured that
security against collective attacks implies also security against any
attack.
<p>
As a special case of the collective attacks, our work also proves security
against the much simpler individual-particle attacks.

The existence of coding schemes to allow unknown
quantum states to be faithfully transmitted through
a noisy channel despite the impossibility of
cloning goes counter to our intuition.  We explain
the different kinds of quantum capacities and how
it is that they can arise, using the quantum
analog of the classical erasure channel as a framework.
Using a new result that nonunitary encodings are not
necessary, for the quantum erasure channel all the capacities can be
derived exactly.  We compare these to
those of the depolarizing channel, for which only upper
and lower bounds on the capacities are known.<br>

We examine the number T of oracle calls that a quantum network requires
to compute some Boolean function on {0,1}<sup>N</sup>. We assume the so-called
<em>blackbox</em> model, where the input is given as an oracle,
and consider exact error-free computation as well as computation
with bounded error-probability.
We show that the acceptance probability of a network with T oracle calls
can be written as an N-variate polynomial of the input, having degree
at most 2T (this result is also implicit in earlier work by Lance Fortnow).
Using lower bounds on the degrees of polynomials that equal or approximate
Boolean functions, we derive lower bounds on T.
In particular:
<UL>
<LI> To compute the <em>parity</em> function on a quantum network, T=N/2 is
both necessary and sufficient. This holds for exact as well as for
bounded-error computation.
<LI>
To compute the <EM>or</EM> and <em>and</EM> functions <em>exactly</EM>, 
we need T=N.
Hence exact database search also requires N oracle calls, whereas Grover's
algorithm requires only O(N<sup>1/2</sup>) queries for bounded-error search.
Our method allows us to give a new proof of the well known
\Omega(N<sup>1/2</sup>) lower bound on bounded-error search.
</UL>
If we restrict to inputs that satisfy some promise, then quantum networks
can sometimes achieve an exponential speed-up compared to classical
randomized methods (Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon).
However, we prove that without promises quantum computing can achieve
only a limited speed-up in the blackbox model:
If a quantum network can compute some total Boolean function F
using T oracle calls with bounded error, then a classical deterministic
decision tree can compute F exactly in O(T<sup>6</sup>) oracle calls.
