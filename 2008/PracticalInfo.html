<h3>Visas</h3>
If you are not an Indian citizen, you will probably need a visa.
Please apply early at an Indian consulate. Getting a visa is often time consuming.

<h3>Flights</h3> 

Mr. Sanjay Goel (summit@alpcord.net, summitalpcord@gmail.com), our
events manager might be able to help you find air tickets.  Please
write to him with your travel plans if you are interested.

<h3>Accommodation</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Participants from India.</b> We have reserved a limited number of
guest house rooms and hostels for Indian participants. <STRIKE>To arrange your
accommodation, fill out the information on the registration
server. Apply early. </STRIKE> <p> We have assigned participants
accommodation based on the requests we received. Please check that
your arrival and departure dates are correct: 
[<a href="QIP2008_files/IndianAcco.html">Room assignment</a>].



<li><b>Participants from outside India.</b>
Participants are responsible for arranging their accommodation.
Hotels in Delhi get expensive and difficult to get in December. So, please apply early.

<p>



<a href="http://www.alpcord.com">SUMMIT: Alpcord Network</a>,
a conference management company, is our official events manager.
Through them, we have blocked some rooms at convenient hotels.  They
promise us that they will provide you the best rates and recommend
that you apply before 1 November 2007. It is expected that this rate
is significantly less than the rates the hotels offer to customers who
approach them directly. If this is not the case, please let the
organisers of QIP 2008 know. 

<p>
Please visit the 
<bold><a href="http://www.alpcordmeditours.com/qip.html"><b>QIP accommodation
page</b></a>

set up by Summit-Alpcord to learn about the services they
offer. There is a form there, which you can fill out and and email to
Mr. Sanjay Goel (summit@alpcord.net, summitalpcord@gmail.com) with a

<p>
At present we have rooms at the following places. To see their
locations, type the addresses on Google Maps.  They are a little
distance away from the QIP venue.  A commute of up to 15km is
reasonable on the wide Delhi roads.  QIP 2008 will arrange transport
between these hotels and the venue. Hotels that are closer are more
expensive. 

<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Chintan guest house:</b> We have heard good reports about this
place from several sources (including faculty at IIT Delhi). This is a
pleasant place with all the basics.  The breakfast is not included in
the room rate, but you can buy yourself one for Rs. 50.  Despite the
slightly longer commute that staying here involves, this place offers
good value for money. 
<p>

<li>
<b>Hotel Grand Sartaj: </b> A regular 3-star hotel. Closer to
the venue. Rooms have been recently refurbished. Easy commute.
Reasonable eating places close by.

<li>
<p>
<b>Asian International:</b> A regular 2-star hotel.  Close to the
venue, and very close to the Connaught Place, in the heart of the city,
if that is where you want to be.

<p>As Summit-Alpcord find more places, they will add them to their 
   web site.

<p> Also, FSTTCS 2007 which immediately precedes QIP 2008 uses a
different company, whom you can approach as well. Please consult the
<a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sanjiva/FSTTCS2007/fsttcs.html">
FSTTCS accommodation page</a> for more information and for tips on 
where to stay.
