CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

The Eleventh Workshop on
QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
India International Centre
New Delhi, India
December 17--21, 2007

SUBMISSIONS of abstracts for CONTRIBUTED TALKS are sought in research
areas related to quantum information science and quantum information
processing. All submissions will be judged primarily by the content of
their first TWO PAGES. Therefore, these two pages should clearly
describe the ideas, results, techniques, and make a comparison with
previous related work. Beyond the first two pages, more details can be
provided; however, any material beyond the first two pages may be
ignored at the discretion of the Program Committee. Submissions that
deviate from this format risk rejection without consideration of their
merits. Submissions MUST be received by 23:59 EDT, SEPTEMBER 20, 2007.

(POSTER submissions are due on November 15, 2007, and instructions
for submitting them will be available at the conference web site.)
