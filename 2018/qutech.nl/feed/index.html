				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The second Quantum Internet Programming Competition has started!</p>
<p><strong>The Challenge<br />
</strong>In this competition, we will have some fun playing games using quantum entanglement!</p>
<p>It turns out that two remote network nodes can use pre-established quantum entanglement to instantanesouly coordinate their actions much better than what is possible on the classical internet. Here, we will have fun coordinating on playing games: if two players in a network play games, they can use quantum entanglement to coordinate their actions better than what is possible classically and thus win the game more often.</p>
<p>In the basic variant of this competition, you will implement a toy example of such a game also known as Mermin’s game. Here will challenge two players to play  a game in which they color in a 3&#215;3 grid: Alice gets to color a row and Bob a column subject to some conditions. They win if they filled the grid consistently and satisfy the conditions. It turns out that no classical strategy can win the game with certainty. However, by using quantum entanglement, Alice and Bob can achieve perfect coordination and win the game every time! We provide a basic piece of code for you, from which you can work to implement this game.</p>
<p><strong>Submissions<br />
</strong>As usual, the sky is the limit on what you wish to do for this programming competition: anything quantum network goes. Here some random ideas for you, starting with the game above:</p>
<p>&#8211; Implement a visual interface for the game!<br />
&#8211; Make a library and/or classical protocol running and evaluating such games!<br />
&#8211; Explore how your game performs in the presence of noise<br />
&#8211; …</p>
<p><strong>Prize<br />
</strong>The programming competition is open for all ages and backgrounds. Deadline for submissions is 19 of october 2018 – i.e. you have 3 months to shine. Submissions by teams are also welcome. The first prize is again a summer internship at QuTech (if you are a team, for up to 3 participants).</p>
<p><strong>Jury<br />
</strong>Jaya Baloo (KPN)<br />
Corsin Pfister (KPN)<br />
Axel Dahlberg (QuTech)<br />
Stephanie Wehner (QuTech)</p>
<p><strong>Instructions<br />
</strong>Detailed instructions can be found here: <a href="http://www.simulaqron.org/competition/">http://www.simulaqron.org/competition/</a></p>
<p>We look forward to your submissions!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Menno Veldhorst has been named to MIT Technology Review’s prestigious annual list of Innovators Under 35. Menno Veldhorst has invented a faster path to real-world quantum circuits by making it possible for them to be printed on silicon &#8211; the way computer chips have been printed for decades. </strong><strong>Prior to Veldhorst’s innovation, it was considered impossible to make usable, semiconductor-based quantum circuits on silicon that would be stable enough to perform useful calculations.</strong></p>
<p>Quantum computers &#8211; which are governed by the strange physics of subatomic particles, and allow powerful calculations that no traditional computer is capable of &#8211; have instead been built with esoteric materials, including superconductors, that are easier to control in their fragile quantum states. The trade-offs: working with such technology is expensive, and producing such circuitry at scale would require inventing entirely new industrial processes. <a href="https://qutech.nl/person/menno-veldhorst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Menno Veldhorst</a> has solved this by using the most replicated manmade structure on the planet &#8211; the transistor. He was able to demonstrate calculations on the basic units of quantum information, known as qubits, in silicon semiconductors.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration with Intel</strong></p>
<p>Now, based on Veldhorst’s breakthrough, Intel is printing hundreds of thousands of such simple systems on the same type of wafers the company uses to make its conventional chips. This means collaborators at Intel can increasingly spend their time on the microelectronics and algorithms necessary for complete quantum computers rather than working through basic physics. What’s most exciting to Veldhorst is that &#8211; just like with the birth of the transistor and the computer age &#8211; a flood of quantum computers will need to be built and put into the hands of researchers for science to really know what they are capable of. Veldhorst’s research has allowed just that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Researchers at QuTech in Delft have succeeded in generating quantum entanglement between two quantum chips faster than the entanglement is lost. Entanglement &#8211; once referred to by Einstein as &#8220;spooky action&#8221; &#8211; forms the link that will provide a future quantum internet its power and fundamental security. Via a novel smart entanglement protocol and careful protection of the entanglement, the scientists led by Prof. Ronald Hanson are the first in the world to deliver such a quantum link ‘on demand’. This opens the door to connect multiple quantum nodes and create the very first quantum network in the world. They publish their results on 14 June in <em>Nature</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quantum Internet</strong><br />
By exploiting the power of quantum entanglement it is theoretically possible to build a quantum internet that cannot be eavesdropped on. However, the realization of such a quantum network is a real challenge: you have to be able to create entanglement reliably, &#8216;on demand&#8217;, and maintain it long enough to pass the entangled information to the next node. So far, this has been beyond the capabilities of quantum experiments.</p>
<p>Scientists at QuTech in Delft have now been the first to experimentally generate entanglement over a distance of two metres in a fraction of a second, &#8216;on demand&#8217;, and subsequently maintain this entanglement long enough to enable -in theory- further entanglement to a third node. ‘The challenge is now to be the first to create a network of multiple entangled nodes: the first version of a quantum internet’, professor Hanson states.</p>
<p><strong>Higher performance</strong><br />
In 2015, Ronald Hanson&#8217;s research group already became world news: they were the first to generate long-lived quantum entanglement over a distance (1.3 kilometres), , allowing them to providefull experimental proof of quantum entanglement for the first time. This experiment is the basis of their current approach to developing a quantum internet: distant single electrons on diamond chips are entangled using photons as mediators.</p>
<p>However, so far this experiment has not had the necessary performance  to create a real quantum network. Hanson: &#8216;In 2015 we managed to establish a connection once an hour, while the connection only remained active for a fraction of a second. It was impossible to add a third node, let alone multiple nodes, to the network.’</p>
<p><strong>Entanglement on demand</strong><br />
The scientists have now made multiple innovative improvements to  the experiment. First of all, they demonstrated a new entanglement method. This allows for the generation of entanglement forty times a second between electrons at a distance of two metres. Peter Humphreys, an author of the paper, emphasises: &#8216;This is a thousand times faster than with the old method.’ In combination with a smart way of protecting the quantum link from external noise, the experiment has now surpassed a crucial threshold: for the first time, entanglement can be created  faster than it is lost.</p>
<p>Through technical improvements, the experimental setup is now always ready for &#8216;entanglement-on-demand&#8217;. Hanson: &#8216;Just like in the current internet, we always want to be <em>online</em>, the system has to entangle on each request.’ The scientists have achieved this by adding smart quality checks. Humphreys: &#8216;These checks only take a fraction of the total experimental time, while allowing us to ensure that our system is ready for entanglement, without any manual action&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>Networks</strong><br />
The researchers already demonstrated last year that they were able to protect a quantum entangled link while a new connection was generated.  By combining this and their new results, they are ready to create quantum networks with more than two nodes.  The Delft scientists now plan to realize such a network between several quantum nodes. Hanson: &#8216;In 2020, we want to connect four cities in the Netherlands via quantum entanglement. This will be the very first quantum internet in the world.’</p>
<p>This work was supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through a VICI grant and by the European Research Council through a Starting Grant and a Synergy Grant.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no doubt that the quantum computer and the quantum internet have many profound applications, they may change the way we think about information, and they could completely change our daily life.</p>
<p>But how do a quantum computer and a quantum internet work? What scientific principles are behind it? What kind of software and protocols do we need for that? How can we operate a quantum computer and a quantum internet? And which disciplines of science and engineering are needed to develop a fully working system?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/the-building-blocks-of-a-quantum-computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Enrol now in this course on EdX.org</strong></a></p>
<p>This course will be divided into two parts. In the first part, you will get an insight into and an overview of the first layer of the quantum computer and the quantum internet: the qubits. In the second part of this course, which will be live early September 2018, we will continue and introduce the other elements needed to build a quantum computer and a quantum internet.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In spring 2018 the Executive Board of Delft University of Technology installed a Vision Team Quantum Society to take social leadership in the development of quantum technologies. The vision team will explore the impacts that quantum technology might have on society. Pieter Vermaas, Associate Professor at the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management, chairs the team. He will be accompanied by researchers from several Delft based faculties, such as Industrial Design Engineering and Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science.</p>
<p><strong>About the Quantum Vision Team<br />
</strong>The vision team will focus on quantum communication and quantum computing related to quantum communication. A key topic is cryptology since quantum technologies pose treats to the security of current digital communication and enable new full security for future quantum communication. The team will provide an overview of questions, concerns and future images from different stakeholders of the impacts on society. It will also evaluate realism and desirability of possible future scenarios for these new technologies in the coming six months.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Since the breakthrough discovery of the Majorana particle in 2012 in Delft, researchers faced great challenges. An international team of researchers from the Netherlands (QuTech, Microsoft and Eindhoven University of Technology) and United States (JQI Maryland, UC Santa Barbara) joined forces to understand the next steps required to improve the experiments. Now, the scientists provide a complete toolbox for the final proof of Majorana existence, paving the way towards Majorana quantum bits. They publish their work in <a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/nature26142">Nature</a>.</em><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Majorana</strong></p>
<p>In 1937, Ettore Majorana predicted a new, fundamental particle that is later named after him: the Majorana particle. The particle has the property of being its own anti-particle. Researcher Hao Zhang: ‘this is very special, usually there is an opposite property in the antiparticle, such as charge: the antiparticle of the electron is the positron.’</p>
<p>Majorana quasiparticles appear in materials in extremely restricted conditions. When a nanowire made from a semiconductor is connected to a superconductive material, researchers see a so-called zero-bias peak in the case of certain electric and magnetic fields. This signal is the main characteristic of the presence of Majoranas.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>See also this <a href="https://qutech.nl/timeline/">Majorana-timeline</a> made my Bruno van Wayenburg.</em></p>
<p><strong>Complete toolbox</strong></p>
<p>In the first experiment of 2012, the zero-bias peak was noisy, and difficult to see. This made the Majorana appearance debatable. In the years that followed, researchers worked very hard on improving the theory, materials and the experimental fabrications. The past months multiple breakthroughs followed each other, completing the research trilogy. Transport in the required materials is improved in two steps: <a href="https://qutech.nl/majorana-highway-chip/">high-quality interfaces</a> and <a href="https://qutech.nl/majoranas-on-the-rise/">superclean Majorana transport</a>. Furthermore, the design of <a href="https://qutech.nl/nano-hashtags-provide-definite-proof-majorana-particles/">nano-hashtags</a> allowed for future exchange of Majorana particles, the final step required for topological quantum computing.</p>
<p>Now the researchers combine all improvements in an experiment to show the <em>quantized conductance</em> of the zero-bias peak. This perfect quantization of the Majorana conductance fits perfectly with theories on the existence of the Majorana’s. Zhang: ‘it is a direct consequence of the particle-antiparticle property.’</p>

<p><strong>Perfect quantum computer</strong></p>
<p>This experiment closes a chapter in the quest for Majorana particles, and opens a new chapter to work towards quantum information processing based on their properties. Their unique physical characteristics make the Majorana particles much more stable than the majority of other qubits. Making and regulating these Majoranas on the way to creating this topological quantum computer is still challenging. The level of control and understanding that is reached now, allows for the exploration of Majorana quantum computing.</p>
<p>The researchers now aim to combine the previous breakthroughs in one experiment to realize a qubit based on four Majorana particles. ‘For that, we need to scale up to more complicated networks such as the nano-hashtags, ‘Hao Zhang explains, ‘and then we finally have a qubit that is protected by its own topology.’</p>
<p>This work was performed in close collaboration between QuTech, TU Delft, JQI(Maryland), Microsoft, TU Eindhoven and UC Santa Barbara.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A TTW open technology programme from <a href="http://www.stw.nl/en/content/grants-february-2018">NWO</a> is awarded to Menno Veldhorst, lead-PI, and to Fabio Sebastiano, Giordano Scappucci, and Carmina Almudever, co-PI’s on this project. The team receives a budget of over 1.2 M€ and will focus in this 5-year project on one of the greatest challenges of this century: to construct a quantum computer that can perform computations that are unsolvable with classical methods. Such a quantum computer has the potential of daily-life changing applications, but its construction is extremely demanding. Thousands to millions of interacting quantum bits will be required, while these building blocks are very fragile. Together with industrial market leaders the team will construct quantum bits that are based on silicon transistors, the most replicated manmade structure in the history of mankind. Large qubit arrays will be fabricated in partnership with Intel Corporation, while cryogenic electronics will be developed together with BlueFors. These together will enable the team to demonstrate quantum operations on a large quantum chip, laying down the path towards a quantum era for computation.</p>
