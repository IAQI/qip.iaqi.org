<i>Fault-tolerant quantum computation with cluster states</i><p>In the one-way quantum computer a quantum computation is performed by
first preparing a special entangled state (the cluster state), and then
performing a sequence of adaptive single-qubit measurements on that state.<p>
This talk will describe two ideas.  First, I will explain a simple
argument for why in some physical systems (particularly optics) it may be
much easier to build a one-way quantum computer than it is to build a
conventional circuit-based computer.<p>
In the second part of the talk I'll discuss how to make the one-way
quantum computer fault-tolerant.  I'll explain why the fault-tolerance is
not obvious from standard thresholds for quantum circuits, and how to
adapt the threshold proof to the one-way quantum computer.
