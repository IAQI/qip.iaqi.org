Entanglement:
drawing private key, locking  by single qubit and erasing</i>

<p>

It is shown that from entanglemed states from which no pure entanglement can
be obtained, secure key can be drawn. States that contain perfectly secret
bit - "quantum p-bits" - are characterized. One of such states is presented,
which has a peculiar feature: its entanglement cost can be reduced from 1/2
log d to zero by removing single qubit. This phenomenon of lockign
entanglement by single qubit is discussed in terms of relations between
entanglement loss versus information loss. Finally, thermodynamical cost of
erasure of entanglement is defined and discussed.
