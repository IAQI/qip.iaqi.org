<i>Tensor norms and the classical communication complexity of nonlocal quantum measurement</i><p>Nonlocality is at the heart of quantum information processing.
In this work we investigate the minimum classical communication
cost required to simulate a nonlocal quantum measurement.
We give general upper bounds, which in turn translate 
to systematic classical simulations of quantum communication 
protocols.<p>
Besides other concrete applications, we prove that if the cost of 
communication is constant, quantum and classical protocols, with shared
entanglement and shared coins, respectively, compute the same class of 
functions. Our upper bounds are expressed in the forms of 
{\em tensor norms}, which capture the nonlocality of bipartite 
measurements in their own way and may be of independent interest and 
further applications.
