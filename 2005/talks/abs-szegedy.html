<i>Quantum Speed-up of Markov Chain Based Algorithms</i><p>We develop a generic method for quantizing classical
algorithms based on random walks. We show that under
certain conditions, the quantum version gives rise to a
quadratic speed-up.  This is the case, in particular,
when the Markov chain is ergodic and its transition
matrix is symmetric.  This generalizes the celebrated
result of Grover and a number of more recent
results, including the element distinctnesss result of 
Ambainis and the result of Ambainis, Kempe
and Rivosh that computes properties of 
quantum walks on the $d$-dimensional torus. 
Among the consequences is a faster
search for multiple marked items.  We show that the
quantum escape time, just like its classical version,
depends on the spectral properties of the transition
matrix with the marked rows and columns deleted.
