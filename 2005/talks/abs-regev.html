<i>On Lattices, Learning with Errors, Random Linear Codes, and Cryptography</i><p>Our main result is a reduction from worst-case lattice problems such as SVP
and SIVP to a certain learning
problem. This learning problem is a natural extension of the `learning from
parity with error' problem to higher
moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of decoding from a random
linear code. This, we believe, gives a strong
indication that these problems are hard. Our reduction, however, is quantum.
Hence, an efficient solution to the
learning problem implies a _quantum_ algorithm for SVP and SIVP. A main open
question is whether this
reduction can be made classical.<p>
Using the main result, we obtain a public-key cryptosystem whose hardness is
based on the worst-case quantum hardness
of SVP and SIVP. Previous lattice-based public-key cryptosystems such as the
one by Ajtai and Dwork were only
based on unique-SVP, a special case of SVP. The new cryptosystem is much
more efficient than previous
cryptosystems: the public key is of size \tilde{O}(n^2) and encrypting a
message increases its size by \tilde{O}(n)
(in previous cryptosystems these values are \tilde{O}(n^4) and
\tilde{O}(n^2), respectively).
