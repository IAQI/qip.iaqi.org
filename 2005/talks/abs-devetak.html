<i>Quantum Shannon Theory: Overview and Recent Results</i><p>Quantum Shannon theory (QST) comprises various asymptotic quantum
information proc essing problems, such as quantum compression, quantum
channel coding, entanglement assisted communication and entanglement
distillation.  We adopt a view of QST as a quantitative theory of
interconversion between information processing resources. In this
formalism, each coding theorem corresponds to an _inequality_ between
resources.  This talk reviews the recent progress in QST, culminating
in entropic solutions to the problem of interconverting noiseless
one-way quantum communication, classical communication and
entanglement in the presence of a noisy bipartite state or channel,
thus unifying a large class of previously known results in the
field. We shall also see classical and quantum examples of noisy
resource _equalities_ involving feedback channels.
