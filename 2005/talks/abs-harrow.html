<i>Efficient Quantum Circuits for Schur and Clebsch-Gordan transforms</i><p>The Schur basis on n d-dimensional quantum systems is a
generalization of the total angular momentum basis that is useful for
exploiting symmetry under permutations or collective unitary
rotations.  I will present efficient (poly(n,d,log 1/epsilon) size for
accuracy epsilon) circuits quantum circuits for the Schur transform,
which is the change of basis between the computational and the Schur
bases.  These circuits are based on efficient circuits for the
Clebsch-Gordan transformation.<p>
I will also present an efficient circuit for a limited version of the
Schur transform in which one needs only to project onto different
Schur subspaces.  This circuit can then be generalized to a generic
circuit for performing the change of basis from a standard basis into
a basis in which the action of a particular representation of a finite
group is block diagonal and irreducible.  This construction
generalizes phase estimation from an abelian setting to a generic
setting involving nonabelian finite groups.
