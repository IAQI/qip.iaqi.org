<i>On the power of quantum multiparty communication complexity</i><p>We define a quantum analog of the classical communication complexity
model of the "Number on the forehead". We show that in this model
there exists an exponential separation for a total function. Moreover,
we describe a connection to circuit depth lower bounds and reduce a
classical question on the power of the class ACC_0  to a question
about a quantum communication lower bound in the above model.
