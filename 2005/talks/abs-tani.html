<i>Exact Quantum Algorithms for the Leader Election Problem</i><p>It is well-known that no classical algorithm can solve 
deterministically 
the leader election
problem in anonymous networks.
This paper proposes two quantum algorithms that,
when parties are connected by quantum communication links,
deterministically solve the problem for any network topology
in polynomial rounds and polynomial communication/local-time complexity in the
number of parties.
