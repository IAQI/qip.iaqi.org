<i>Entanglement of assistance and applications to multi-user quantum information theory</i><p>Entanglement of assistance is the maximum rate of distilling
EPR states between A and B from a tripartite pure state psi_ABC,
when all three players collaborate. We prove that asymptotically,
this is the smaller of A's and B's entropy, and that in fact this
rate can be obtained as the sum of an EPR rate (the entanglement
cost of the reduced state of AB) and a GHZ rate (the rest). There
are also extensions to more than three players. Then we show that
this result has implications for two multi-user quantum information tasks.<p>
First, Gregoratti and Werner's "quantum lost and found", where the
environment of a channel helps the sender and receiver to transmit
quantum states by giving classical information. It turns out that
the quantum capacity is the smaller of the input and output entropies,
maximised over all input states.<p>
Second, a fully quantum version of the Slepian-Wolf distributed
source compression problem, with free classical side communication.
For this we are able to determine the full rate region, in analogy
to the classical Slepian-Wolf theorem, which limits individual rates
by conditional entropies and the rate sum by the total entropy of
the source.
