<i> A new quantum ripple-carry adder</i><p>

We present a new linear-depth ripple-carry quantum addition circuit.
The ripple-carry construction of Vedral, Barenco, and Ekert (1995)
requires linearly many ancillary qubits; our improved adder uses only
a single ancillary qubit.  Also, our circuit has lower depth and fewer
gates.
