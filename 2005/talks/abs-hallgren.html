<i> A Quantum Algorithm for Computing Some Hidden Subgroups of the Symmetric Group</i><p>An important open question in quantum algorithms is whether the
``standard method'' can be used to solve graph isomorphism.  This
refers to the algorithm that is the generalization of Simon's and
Shor's algorithms from abelian groups to the symmetric group $S_n$,
and the goal is to compute which subgroup of $S_n$ arises in the
reduction from graph isomorphism.  The difficulty is that the main
step, computing the quantum Fourier transform over $S_n$, is not
uniquely defined, as it depends on a basis choice for each
representation of $S_n$, and there are an infinite number of
choices.  The main known result about this algorithm is negative and
states that under a random basis the Fourier sampling statistics
reveal an exponentially small amount of information about the hidden
subgroup.  In this paper we give the first positive result by
presenting subgroups which can be distinguished by choosing special
bases.  For example, we show that there are special bases that can
be used to distinguish certain exponentially large sets of small
conjugate subgroups of the symmetric group, in quantum
polynomial-time.
