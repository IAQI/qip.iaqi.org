<i>Reconstruction of quantum channels from incomplete data</i><p>Reconstruction of quantum channels (quantum processes) can be
performed using a set of test states that are transformed by the
action of the channel.  Using correlations between inputs of test
states (these are assumed to be known) and results of measurements of
these states at the output one can estimate a map that characterizes
the action of the channel. We analyze in detail various scenarios of
reconstruction. In particular, we study in detail the situation when
just finite ensembles of test states are available.
