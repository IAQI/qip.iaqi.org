<i>Scaling of entanglement and quantum computation</i><p>We analyze the scaling of entanglement in spin systems,
focusing on its properties at phase transitions and along RG flows. Efficient algorithms are seen to use very large
entanglement. Representing quantum register through their
entanglement provides a method to numerically deal
with large numbers of qubits.
