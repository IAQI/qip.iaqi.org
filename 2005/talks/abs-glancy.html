<i>Quantum Computation with Optical Coherent States</i>
<p>I will discuss a method for encoding qubits in optical coherent states.
 A universal set of quantum logic operations can be performed on these
 qubits using beam splitters, phase shifters, photon counters, and
 entangled resource states.  Some operations suffer from failures and/or
 infidelities, but qubits can be protected from these problems using
 teleportation.  A significant source of decoherence for these qubits
 will be photon absorption.  I will explain how absorption damage the
 qubits, and how that damage can be corrected.
