<i>On the quantum algorithm for approximating the Jones
polynomial.</i><p>


The Jones polynomial is a knot invariant that plays an important role
in various areas in mathematics and physics. It has been known for
some time that the approximation of the Jones polynomial at certain
roots of unity is complete for quantum computation: this means that
there is an efficient quantum algorithm for it, and if you can do it
you can do all of quantum computation. However, this result (due to
several works of Freedman, Kitaev, Larsen and Wang) is hardly known to
the quantum computing community since it was presented in the language
of topological field theories. I will present an algorithm from first
principles to approximate the Jones polynomial.  Joint work with
Vaughan Jones and Zeph Landau.
