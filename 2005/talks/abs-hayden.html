<i>The Remarkable Ubiquity of Entanglement</i><p>Despite being hard to manufacture in the real world, entanglement
is abundant in Hilbert space. In fact, surprisingly large randomly chosen
subspaces of a given bipartite quantum system will contain only
near-maximally entangled states. I'll describe the intuition behind this
result and a number of its consequences. These include a proof that the
quantum identification capacity of 1 ebit is 2 qubits and a protocol for
sending quantum states from Alice to Bob that achieves the same rates as
the well-known "superdense coding" result: 2 qubits can be sent by
physically transmitting only 1 qubit and consuming 1 ebit.<p>
