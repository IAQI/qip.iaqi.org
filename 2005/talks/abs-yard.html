<i>Capacity theorems for quantum multiple access channels</i><p>We consider quantum channels with two senders and one
receiver.  For an arbitrary such channel, we give
multi-letter characterizations of two different
two-dimensional capacity regions.  The first region 
characterizes the rates at which it is possible for one
sender to send classical information, while the 
other sends quantum information.  The second region gives
the rates at which each sender can send quantum
information.  We give examples of channels for which both
regions have single-letter characterizations.  We conclude
with connections to other work and a conjecture on a
generalization where each user simultaneously sends
classical and quantum information.<p>
