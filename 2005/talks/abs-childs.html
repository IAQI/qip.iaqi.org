<i>Optimal measurements for the dihedral hidden subgroup
problem</i><p>

We consider the dihedral hidden subgroup problem as the problem of
distinguishing hidden subgroup states. We show that the optimal
measurement for solving this problem is the so-called pretty good
measurement. We then prove that the success probability of this
measurement exhibits a sharp threshold as a function of the density
nu=k/log N, where k is the number of copies of the hidden subgroup state
and 2N is the order of the dihedral group. In particular, for nu<1 the
optimal measurement (and hence any measurement) identifies the hidden
subgroup with a probability that is exponentially small in log N, while
for nu>1 the optimal measurement identifies the hidden subgroup with a
probability of order unity. Thus the dihedral group provides an example of
a group G for which Omega(log|G|) hidden subgroup states are necessary to
solve the hidden subgroup problem. We also consider the optimal
measurement for determining a single bit of the answer, and show that it
exhibits the same threshold. Finally, we consider implementing the optimal
measurement by a quantum circuit, and thereby establish further
connections between the dihedral hidden subgroup problem and average case
subset sum problems. In particular, we show that an efficient quantum
algorithm for a restricted version of the optimal measurement would imply
an efficient quantum algorithm for the subset sum problem, and conversely,
that the ability to quantum sample from subset sum solutions allows one to
implement the optimal measurement.
